So in order to discuss an article you made up a bunch of stuff that wasn't in the article, implied it was in the article, and failed to discuss anything that was actually in the article. I see.   Will this be a one time thing, or is this the sort of thing we should expect from you on a regular basis? Just wondering.
Old habits die hard and dogs don't pay attention to clocks!
They only need 1/4 of the legislature, so they'll probably get that. But if it actually gets to the polls? The conservatives took a big hit when they ran around screaming "If gays get married society will collapse and we'll all be doomed!!!11!1!!" and then nothing happened. And of course the most organized group in Mass. opposing gay marriage is the Mass. Catholic church, and people aren't going to take kindly to a bunch of child rapers telling them what's right and wrong. The anti-gay side really doesn't have much to work with; it'll largely be a contest of good will and common sense vs. scare tactics, and the scare tactics have already been proven wrong.
well if you think the sun goes around the earth then its time for apocalypse.
I dunno. What is the scoop here? You complain about the responses we give, and yet you keep coming back for more. Even people with down syndrome learn enough to only stick their hands in the open flame once.
yea...it's like ordering a pizza. First the paleontologist digs up a bone or other artifact...then he calls the lab, tells them what he found and gives them the date they can expect the bone to arrive for "testing." Then the lab asks him from what organism the bone once belonged and also what toppings, I mean dates, he wants for his bone. Then the paleontologist gives him the range of dates that most suit his presuppositions.....Then the paleontologists sends in the bone fed-ex, along with a gift-certificate to the finest steakhouse in town and two tickets to the ballgame, and then sits back and waits for the results. Finally, just to be on the safe side, the paleontologist repeats this scenario with at least 2 more labs...this way just in case one doesn't cooperate he has backup and he can pick a date from any number of labs.
Abstinance?! Heaven forbid.
So, in summation, your position is that the US should be more like the Europeans? Should we also bathe less frequently? Have poor dental hygeine? Become an "also ran" economy? No thanks. I have no desire to mimic Europe.
I see. Then what you are claiming is that creationists are the ones who should define the vocabulary to be used by evolutionary biologists. Would it then be ok for atheists to define the vocabulary of Christianity?
BREAKING NEWS: SHOOTING IN DALLAS OFFICE TOWER - CTnow   Ah, the good old gun-crazy US of A.
Just trying to help out where I can, and if it proves you right well that makes a first time huh?Sarge its a first!!
More silliness on your part. Think about it. Gay couples together for 40 or 50 years. That means they were living together in the 1950s and 1960s. Those people were the foundation of the gay-pride movement.
So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.
And yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children...
So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?   Wouldn't it just be easier, as well as more likely, for an emotionally disturbed student to just illegally bring a gun to school and kill their teacher, rather than waiting for a legal alternative to commit murder and go to prison anyway?
Well then who do I have to call? I'd like to report Brady for being in possession of 13,000 rounds of restricted armor piercing ammunition and 100 guns, most of which have been illegally modified for full-auto firing capabilities, as well as an uncounted number of IEDs.   The link doesn't work, BTW.
Jesus! Another scientific illiterate. The facts are the observations. And the point is not to test facts but to explain them with an hypothesis that suggests a prediction as a consequence that can be tested by experimentation.
You mean that hole that has been observed and proven, repeatedly? Climate Change is a controversy in the same way as the earth being broadly spherical is a controversy. There's a group of nutters who think the earth is flat; doesn't mean there is any reason to believe it is.
Props for what? Refusing to read your middle school biology textbook?
YES, of course, they could not actually hunt, since that would be illegal, possibly a felony, whihc could lead to forfeiture of your rights.
and
Just a reminder, Belfrey: Don't hold your breath...
Is the little baby upset? Too bad.
Thats a very compact piece of logic.   I imagine that you are a very efficient individual.
Its better then being dead.............
So are you saying that the people of India aren't upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered? Are you saying that the people of India aren't seeking changes so they can arm themselves accordingly so if something like this happens again they'll be better prepared to handle it?
Who but a creationist would ever make such a laughable claim?
At least you are aware of your own mental deficiencies.
And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell.
Here's a link for you: Two Eyes   Fish   Amphibians   Reptiles   Birds   Mammals   Coincidence?   Limited Imagination?   Interrelation?
I see. So, you know the souls of others? and how God will judge them?   Interesting. That certainly does settle a few things....
F--k'in A! right! I don't want some damn MAN deciding what's going to be legal for my body. They have NO experience with the female anatomy except what they manage to bag, they shouldn't be allowed to decide for us.   They have no idea what pregnancy is like, the damage it does to our bodies and our minds, and they don't have to pay to support a child that we were forced to accept at knifepoint.   Where is the logic is violating women a second time? Where's the justification for it? Doesn't the life of the unintended mother account for anything at all?   Do you men have any idea of the dangerous precdent you'd be setting up with a total ban on abortion? Women who have been raped and essentially told "You WILL have this child, you WILL carry it to term, or you WILL go to prison!" would likely commit suicide as a result, meaning that TWO lives are gonna be lost.
Oh, we already know a bunch of events that he played a role in. They even made it into a song!   Please allow me to introduce myself   I'm a man of wealth and taste   I've been around for long, long years   Stole many man's soul and faith   And I was 'round when Jesus Christ   Had his moment of doubt and pain   Made damn sure that Pilate   Washed his hands and sealed his fate   Pleased to meet you   Hope you guess my name   But what's puzzling you   Is the nature of my game   I stuck around St. Petersburg   When I saw it was a time for a change   Killed the Czar and his ministers   Anastasia screamed in vain   I rode a tank   Held a general's rank   When the blitzkrieg raged   And the bodies stank   Pleased to meet you   Hope you guess my name, oh yeah   Ah, what's puzzling you   Is the nature of my game, oh yeah   (woo woo, woo woo)   I watched with glee   While your kings and queens   Fought for ten decades   For the gods they made   (woo woo, woo woo)   I shouted out,   "Who killed the Kennedys?"   When after all   It was you and me   (who who, who who)   Let me please introduce myself   I'm a man of wealth and taste   And I laid traps for troubadours   Who get killed before they reached Bombay   (woo woo, who who)   Pleased to meet you   Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah   (who who)   But what's puzzling you   Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby   (who who, who who)   Pleased to meet you   Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah   But what's confusing you   Is just the nature of my game   (woo woo, who who)   Just as every cop is a criminal   And all the sinners saints   As heads is tails   Just call me Lucifer   'Cause I'm in need of some restraint   (who who, who who)   So if you meet me   Have some courtesy   Have some sympathy, and some taste   (woo woo)   Use all your well-learned politesse   Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah   (woo woo, woo woo)   Pleased to meet you   Hope you guessed my name, um yeah   (who who)   But what's puzzling you   Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down   (woo woo, woo woo)   Woo, who   Oh yeah, get on down   Oh yeah   Oh yeah!

Translation = "I've closed my brain off and I've got not nothing."
So you are saying that despite the majority of the public opposing gay marriage, opposing it may be the wrong direction?   Good for you. You're getting it.
Oh my goodness. This is a trick called semantics.   I guess you got sucked in.   Yes, abortion is used as contraception unfortunately.
We have a terrorist supporter among us, objecting to restrictions on terrorists! Why do you hate America?
See, this is where reading the page would have helped you out alot. No where does it say that organisms evolve with a changing environment. That's what WW would like it to say, but it says nothing of the sort. All it talks about is a different approach to modeling cell behavior. Critical reading skills, they're really essential if you're going to try to debate science.
Seeing the article you linked to was written in 2002, over three years ago, do you think the author could perhaps incorporate the new data and rename his piece, "Maybe There Is Some Truth About Pedophile Priests After All"?
So what? The allele frequency, even in your example has still changed. A change in an allele frequency in a population over time is, by definition, evolution. What did you think that evolution was?
I think there are few better things than self-evident irony. I love it.
Well I don't know about you guys, but I was baptized so I'm out of that eternal damnation thing.
Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?
Oh, his brain wasn't there, huh? Musta just been involuntary reflexes that allowed him walk from a store to the "home" that he stayed at.   Oh, and please show me some cases of foetuses walking to the store like this man did when he was attacked, and then we can start comparing.   Looks like VT is back with his usual strawmen and sensationalism.
Well, at some point they are sentient beings(surely you agree), that's the point that the fetus becomes a person in my opinion. Before that it's not really too bad. I don't have a problem with people "having sex in an improper way" or choosing to "screw each other how they would like to screw each other". I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said "They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by "less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen. I will just continue to have pity for all of the irresponsible "lovers" out there.
Is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?
No. Anyone who sticks to beliefs that a god created the earth just 6,000 years ago is an XXXXX. People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the "XXXXX" label.   Hope this clarifies things for you.
There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed. This is all we have ever observed. The earliest creatures -according to your theories dating- had incredibly formed eyes etc. and no ancestors among the fossils   It also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed.   +It predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.   It predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.   It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.   It predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.   It predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.   It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.   It predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.   That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.   You present a brilliant argument. How could anyone argue with your brand of logic? That would be senseless.
Actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. And anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides.
And LIVING ones even more... ok Adolph.
Please stop demonstrating your complete inability to understand evolutionary theory. How is Texas Stadium meaningful in the population of the earth? Do various blimp pilots who soar over Texas Stadium have better sexual success than you? You seem to be a bit of a sad sack.
Hmmm... interesting. Where does this inalianable right derive from and how does it really work? I mean, clearly you cannot create your own army called Islamic Jihad of Al queda Supporters and start to develop weapons of mass destruction on your own farm, regardless if that organisation actually interfer with someone else.   As for bootlicking   Please drop the rethorics and explain how you mean instead.
So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about.
HEY!! We agree on something.
So let's just kill them and be done with it. Is that what you're saying?
You believe that your interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than his, and he believes that his interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than yours. This is quite simple, but that's never really helped you see the problem before...   Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.   No, marc, you're looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.   Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?   "Concise and readable" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.   marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his "citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts."   I figure it's his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.   Considering atheists don't believe in the supernatural, there's nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the "on" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.   Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this "power," too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: "He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do."   Miller [about marc]: "He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do."   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: "He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do."   Miller [about marc]: "He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do."   Yes, I'd speculate that he doesn't have such trouble "stomaching" priests. After all, he shares their beliefs, and not those of preachers of other (e.g. Protestant) sects, many of whom refuse to recognize Catholicism as truly Christian...   Keep on diggin', marc. I love helping you reach new lows.
Your use of language is rather colourful here (lying propagandist!) and smacks of hyperbole. What is being critisised here is bad application of the scientific method in relation to National Geographic's articles on the nature of relationship between birds and dinosaurs. I think Olsen makes some very pertinent points, but at no stage is he saying that evolution does not occur or the possibility that there is no link between any theropods and birds ever.   What he correctly draws attention to is poor peer review and less than conclusive evidence to support the hypothesis of the article's author. In turn this is a stinging criticism of the NG given its high profile, reputation and claim to being a leading forum for the presentation of science in a popular format.
It's sophomoric remarks like that that hurt the gay cause in America.   God isn't mocked, though. And I doubt the people are either.   And I'm glad California outlawed the sin. The only thing you have left is to hope the far left, spiritually-stunted judges in the US Supreme Court are pro Sodom and Gomorrah.
So you're claiming that you "transformed" from part of your mother to a human. So you're claiming that you were once almost your mom's arm or leg? lol! Biologically, this is simply a farce statement.
Give me three good reasons why a thirteen year old girl from Plam Beach, that are practial not religous please, should not have an abortion and I will promise not to make fun of you. Much.   Judges do this everyday. This case just made the news.
So did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words? You are the first mind reader I have encountered here. And considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science. According to you all science should be terrible. Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful?
You mean you can choose how you accept it?
So in other words, you're saying that somewhere along the lines, God changed his mind.
And yet you seem to feel we should leave these issues to the government, which has done nothing but corporate takeovers in regard to banks, automotive industries, and now health care.
Because parents of children without Downs never die prematurely.   C'mon Simone.
Well you never know cause your pro life and for the death penalty.
Almighty nature? You mean you believe in the universe? Welceom to the club. I think we can all agree we're part of the universe. Except for skeptics, they delude themsleves into thinking they cannot know (which they claim to know).   -Mach
Yes, you are 100% correct. Criminals would be sure to pay the tax on their illegally owned pistol, just like they pay income tax on drug money.   Oh, wait they don't pay tax on their drug money.   Most criminals break the law you see.
So you're going to live with the Amish eh?
Wrong again sherlock. All of this animosity is after the fact to why radical islam considers our christian Nation to be hypocritical due to the exporting of our pop culture of hedonistic sexual and moral depravity. That was why they signed fatwas against us originally. It is the abortions, gay marriage and our women walking around half naked that caused that lack of respect to occur. And you can thank the immoral left for that contribution to Americas image. It was the Left that coined the phrase, "If it feels good, do it," Not the Right.
Are we talking about the same Obama here? The same one, who's head of the DHS, told law enforcement to be on the lookout for anyone who disagreed with the government?
*walks in*   *looks at posters*   *notes no fundies have spoken out yet*   Well, it's OBVIOUS that you don't have a discerning spirit and are thinking with your carnal mind. If you'd only have accepted the truth of the undying and never changing word of God, then you'd understand.   You just gottsta believe first.   It's as simple as that.   But, no, you go right on hating God and you'll soon see where that will get you.   BURNING IN HELL!!!   Hahahah, FOOL!   You are soo going to roast. In pain. FOR EVER!   But, that's not my words.   That's Gods!   Me?   I love you.   I love you long time.   Like forever even.   If only you'd accept Jesus into your heart.   Cause if you did.   You'd see no contradictions in what you posted.   Seriously...   Drink the flavoraid.   edit:   Capitalize, size increase, italicize and underline various parts of my post. Color them some and insert random, out of contest bible passages to support my claims.
In the case of Demorats and liberals; it is monkey see, monkey do.
And the man who impregnated the woman should walk away totally free of all responsibility!   Spoken just like an total misogynist!
Well, this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum, it is likely, he'd be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe'd actually be contributing to the pro-choice position...
Tiger is entitled. Because of his money and fame, he's entitled to some hot and not-so-hot action.
If I ever see Arch defend a position at EvC I will eat my hat and the hat of my fiance, too.
Yeah, I should, then we could have a more intelligent converstation   You understand that in the Plaxico Burris case, the "authorities" did just exactly that, found ammo of a different caliber and assumed he had those guns too. Article today on that at RKBA.   Of course, you would probably be more interested in this:   Texas jury jails man 35 years for marijuana possession. Raw Story At first I thought maybe you had come to see old Doc and got waylaid on the way. Nice to see you posting whatever!
Is that what you said right before they started banning assault weapons? 'Oh, let's just see what Sarah Brady wants to do?' Obviously, you're gullible. Since you're such a brainiac and all, why don't you visit the UN website and see what your beloved UN is up to?   And again, read this slower this time (if that helps) 'On the other hand, not one acceptable reason for individuals owning guns is mentioned.'
And if that was the accepted rule for Constitutional interpretation we would still have Jim Crow and the 14th Amendment would be as useful as the 3rd.   Total Fail on your part again Galileo . . .
So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.
Like talking to Richard?
And pray tell what new and interesting creatures have you seen the present ones evolve into this week?
Wow ehat a brave new world you live in.... Now lets say just 1% of all gun owners resisted (in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land). With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this?
Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.
And you say juleacatz is the one who views pregnancy as a punishment for women.
Like the crusades and the inquisition? How about the Southern Baptist Convention, formed at the end of the Civil War with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks? And of course, the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you. Of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't. But when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so I just never turn my back on them. That way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, I will at least have my eye on my money.
Ahh. Now I see why you turned into an agnostic, if you even believed Christianity in the first place.
Really? I have not seen one coherent idea from both of them combined.
But don't you see?   They aren't sure.   They don't know.   They didn't "prove" anything!!
Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases.
No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is "pro-evolution". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's "faith-based" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach
Apparently you've got one powerful set of rose colored glassed.   I guess you spend a lot of money on those 1-900 psychics too.   Nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate? Are you serious?   Waxy
Well you better hurry up. Aren't you like 113 years old or something?
I'd rather be "offed" than to live with a wild eyed screaming banshee like yourself setting policy and demanding impossible tasks.   Are the police SOB'S too? I don't suppose you would object to the friendly neighborhood rapist getting shot by a gun owning neighbor now would you?
**   Again, sez u.
What's your point? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density, so they can get around all they want.
Biblical literism is the only way to view the Bible. I could 'metaphorically' say that Dawkins really believes in God in his own way, because he said that ID is possible for this planet because aliens may have seeded the first self replicating molecule here Millions of years ago.   That is silliness or even foolishness. Nothing taken literally from the Bible is irrational. God is rational and His creation is rational.   In fact, the "Scientific Method" originated from the idea that the Physical Universe operates on rational physical laws because the Creator did it in logical fashion.   What did we have b4 that? "Dragons eating the moon during an eclipse'? Angry gods causing volcanoes to erupt? Apollo racing his fiery chariot across the sky every day?
So reading and literature aren't to be taught?   I love it. More stupid, paranoid parents for me to mock mock mock. They are sooo part of a great big problem. A problem that sees my kid getting threatened and bullied - so I feel totally justified in my mocking. Frankly, there are days I would like to kick them in the teeth.
Six people out of, at the very least one million, at the very most five million.   Are you really gonna prosecute one million plus people based on the actions of six individuals? Are you expecting a 1,000% perfection standard from gun owners?   How many catholic priests have molested little children? Should we hold them all responsible?   How many gun control supporters also support the killing of unborn children?   Or better yet, how many game animals have died of starvation and disease, because gun control supporters lobbied against hunting seasons?
I loved this part:   So Miller says that ID is less worthy, scientifically, than even Young Earth Creationism!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know how this can be true. Thank God that I didn't grow up with my biological father. I'm not really interested in being a jerk.
As long as we cut off the privates of the fathers as well.
Zardozy, honey, whushoo gotta b'lieve in?   You related to that Frenchie guy with the skinny wife?
If we did not have criminals, we wouldnt have "shoot outs" as you so call them.
So you're a historian now?   Yes, you are right - the Civil War was fought to keep the union in tact. But, it is also a fact that Abraham Lincoln, the Commander in Chief of the Union Army, did not believe that the union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   According to who? Though it may not have been practiced to its fullness, it in no way follows that all men are not created equal.   Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.
And liquor.
So you're saying that God is a "respector"?-of-persons - iow, the mom's "more"-important to *God*? than the unborn.
No biggie, right? Typical creationist "teach the controversy" stuff. But wait! The "encyclopedia" follows this up with it's damning evidence to show the many holes in the ToE! Read on evolutionists, and despair!!
Oh but you forgot the rest of my secret plan. Just like Hitler, first you take the guns, then you send them to 'jail'. A jail with 'showers' and 'ovens'.   The most important part of the plan is make sure anti-gunners don't have guns. Which ofcourse is not a problem.
How were they able to get an "aggravated assault" charge pinned on you?   I'm assuming she never had a mark on herself to show the cops.   Had you two had a previous domestic call history with the police?   Hopefully justice will be served when you get your day in court.   Then you'll get to experience the wonder that is "family court", if you haven't already.   You have my sympathies.
And let's do away with these stinking debate forums!   So if it's silly to discuss that, what about brand of trucks? Would that also be silly?   V10 Gasoline or 6.0 Diesel?   How big a tire can you put on a stock 3/4 ton truck?   See, you're right. It's just silly.
No, they don't. Creationists do. "Why haven't all animals turned into humans?"
And I propose we put lunatics who make threats to completely legitimate doctors in a state mental ward for a few years to straighten them out.   As to the abortion issue, are the pro lifers really that willing to risk one of their precious fetuses over a traffic ticket?!
so is it better to be murdered by a knife than a gun?   final thought, you are advacating removing hundrides of millions of dollers of property from millions of legal gun owners, becouse of thousandes of scum bags.
You're starting to sound like someone who understands evolution. I don't see your argument here, you're basically supporting the steps necessary for natural selection. What you describe is one small step for evolution, you just have to repeat this 1,000,000 times over various other environmental and competitive contraints and viola, you'll probably see evolution at work on a scale that you can recognize.   You're almost there montalban!   -Mach
Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained.
And I suspect WW understands it about as well as you do...
wow....there is a real person under there. Good luck on your recovery, chemist.
Well, actually, I did find it funny even though I'm a male (or at least, I think I am?)...probably because it's a joke and I know I'm not like the stereo-typical male so I can laugh at them.   PS, I'm so unique because I'm so humble and would never brag about my bulging muscles, manhood and amazing intellect.
So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?
I know you don't. So what?
Oh.. that makes sense. Because, it sounds exactly like modern day republicans.
(Playing devil's advocate)   And, by what authority would you deny a woman's "right to choose" an abortion that happens to be "late in her pregnancy?"
You are like, so totally noble and sensitive! I really admire your pro-humanity stance. That is going out on limb.
So the real victim here is that society won't be as you WANT it to be, and that's the real "casualty" here...   Wow!
I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us.   (Alan Keyes, the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama. The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack. Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to "represent" NY'ers. Yeah, look who's the hypocrit now.)
What about them? Is this a question?
Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental, nebulas natural selection, or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric.
You mean to tell me that you would deny a woman's right to her own body for a zygote, yet you have no problem murdering real human beings? Sounds like a conservative to me...
I think the same about religion. Why should you get your way and tryannise women, and I not get mine?
How do you know?
Well, j, the blah blah blah part was pretty important.   It said, "Seife is referring to how information continues to exist in some form after it has been violently altered; the smoke from a burning newspaper contains data about the newspaper's content, albeit impossible to reconstruct, and even black holes seem not to truly eradicate the information in the matter they consume. All of which has nothing to do with Dembski's claim..." which is true. One definition has nothing to do with the other. Blah blah blah.   http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/903
Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?
No, you're the NRA's wet dream.
How tolerant. Lets talk about the Spanish Inquisition.
what about to d-y-k-e-s marrying each other, would you call it "butch-ery"?
Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.
If blacks are offered a bus ride, why does it matter where they sit while they are on the bus? They get all the same benefits.   What's the beef...except that you can't say that you're at the "front of the bus"?
Because you are a Darwinist - this predictible insult testifies to my rightness.   Your approval/compliments would of supported my wrongness.   Ray M.
Oh they think they can Doc! They think that we gun owners are the terrorist!   Personally. I think that all of this talk about Gun Control is happening because they are mad. They are MAD that a Black Man! Is in the White House!
Oh, I get it… Flashlights and I-Pods have souls and consciousness.
and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES.
You know what is absolutely incredible about you little child? You constantly make the most blatantly ignorant and irrational statements which have no basis at all in reality, yet you actually think you are being intelligent. (Note childs quote in my siggy, below.) And you really should look up definitions before using words when you have no idea what they mean. Didn't you start a thread about that, hypocrite?   You are talking to a person who accepts Intelligent Design as a rational explanation for Mans origin, yet you are so ill informed that you allege he is aligned with a belief in animism, when animism was founded in pagan religions and asserts that pretty much everything has a soul and spirit.   Animism (from Latin anima (soul, life)[1][2]) commonly refers to a religious belief that souls or spirits exist in animals, plants and other entities, in addition to humans.[3] Animism may also attribute souls to natural phenomena, geographic features, and even manufactured objects. Religions which emphasize animism in this sense include Shinto, Hinduism and pagan faiths such as folk religions and Neopaganism.Animism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Now show me a christian who defends ID, believes that, you mental midget.
Sinjin, we aren't talking about the 17th and 18th centuries.
And they wonder why the science community doesn't take them seriously...
That is your belief. You've no evidence provided other than it is just your belief.
You know, I'd believe that more if there were people like the Shindler family who have pushed for federal courts to intervene and destroy the sanctity of marriage. There is nothing you could do or say that would convince me that Americans somehow have any respect for marriage whatsoever. What heterosexuals have done to destroy this institution from the inside out only tells me that heteros are simply spoiled children who have the attitude of:   "If we can't make it work, we aren't going to allow anyone else to come in and do marriage better."
Since when was having the gov't recognize a marriage a human right?
Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making.
And if I did then so what? Hiter's Mom and Saddam's Mom both were given the option to abort their pregnancies by nurses and decided against it.   So I guess this makes pro-lifers responsible for the holocaust and the slaughter of Kurds?
Me, too. I'd probably throw in some counseling as well, just for starters.
You know, I'm thinking of suggesting that they put a permanent link to an online dictionary on this forum.   http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=designed   You could take "intelligently" to mean that the being is conscious of what it's doing; that it's doing what it is purposefully.
How strange. It seems that Habbit's definition of the word definition is meaningless. Physicists and chemists can define what they mean by the word "carbon," but according to Habbit that is just their opinion. According to Habbit, carbon can be a chocolate candy meant to be eaten in a car. That may be his opinion and he considers it as valid as specific definitions assigned to words used by experts in any given field.
Not!   OK, too short, Not!
And you have just described "creation science." No application of the scientific method. No testing. The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun. I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below. You show that you are what you decry.
It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers. To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous.   Wow! You can read Wiki's pseudo-knowledge. I'm impressed!   Now, tell me how the court can rule a California Constitutional Amendment to be unconstitutional before it strikes down the Federal Law that gives states the FEDERAL right to ignore other state's gay marriages.
So you've never repeated a sin?
I'm not going to go into what is wrong with the idea of God without knowing it is what we mean we speak the word.   Excuse me if I am mistaken, but it seems that you are getting defensive on your belief before I even begin a debate. I'm simply looking for any one wishing to participate on the nature / existance of God.   If you find my questions to be complete nonsense and that I'm only here to critize theism than you need not participate.   thebootfitter,
Just can't satisify "them thar' Moralizers." I remember the election of 1960, and how many were worried about JFK taking his "orders from Rome." Maybe that is why we are a land of laws, not of men.
Well, then, I guess that in America we can't possibly be safe from kill-happy gunners can we?
Have you seen who our current President is?
If you dont believe that muslims love life they will cut your head right off! Its an easy choice if you ask me.
oh, sure...ok...whatever you say.
Target shooting and handgun hunting, for starters. There's also self-defense, although not many people seem to have a great desire to defend themselves.   If there's no legal use for a handgun, then why do all those cops carry them?
Like the crazy idea the Earth goes around the Sun.
So it's alright for a Evo to insult you and go off on a tangent, and expect to get answer. What's the point in answering if your being mocked, before you give answer. Now I know why there are few Creo's on this forum.
i think slave holder's asked a similar question to people who believed slavery was wrong.   "what are they worth anyways?? why do they deserve to be treated like us?" hmm
you know what..you are right, any unwanted person should be killed. Lets start with nursing homes and then move on to mental health clinics. After that, we should kill all the poor people because they don't really help society that much. OH! and don't forget the handicapped...who would wanna live like that? Kill them...it is merciful...who cares what they want anyway, they don't know what they are saying. Then we will have a wonderful society
Oh, and I found this from here:   http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/112/9/1291   "The discovery of species-specific as well as universal intercellular signaling molecules reveals that bacteria interact with one another using surprisingly sophisticated mechanisms of communication. In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression."   It appears biologists haven't gotten it wrong, evolution is the explaination for bacterial signaling. And the bacteria still isn't exhibiting any intelligence. The only one getting anything wrong here is you.
Could you avoid your constant use of strawman`s fallacies please?
So, whether the embryo/fetus/whatever-you-want-to-call-it has rights seems to be a non-issue. Because, for pro-choice folk, even if it has rights, it still is preferable to ensure that it can be legally killed.   Of course, it is obvious to everyone that an entity does not need rights in order to have legal protections. But I'll let that slide for now.
Blah, blah, blah.   Stop throwing out discredited and biased stories. Explain in your own terms, exactly how having a gun makes you more likely to be shot. Explain the mechanics of how this works. Go on and try, make some sense rather than cherry picking poorly executed "studies" that prove nothing.   You made the claim that if you have a gun in your possession, this fact magnifies your chances of somehow being shot. What you suggest can only happen if magic somehow exists, like the legally-owned guns sends out powerful magnetic waves to attract the criminals and hypnotizes them to shoot in a situation that they normally wouldn't shoot.
Repeating superstitious nonsense makes it no less mythological than the first, second and third time you were shown it to be so. Skeletons, even from the BRONZE age, let alone your incorrect reference to the stone age, are not fossils.
as in anyone can purchase a fire arm without a background check or gun safety training? not a good option. my apology if that was a failed sarcasm.   -alex
I presume that is a joke. Criminals have always had guns ban or not
Good lesson! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions. Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you...you should just casually drive away. Thanks Simone!   probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.   the fetus would be a real person...and it seems like....in order to make the iraq war/abortion connection....you would have to support the war!
Time to get a helmet...
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/wo.../25orphan.html   But they are not fetuses, alas, so who gives a damn?
Really! Why not? I'm very interested.   I think you're wrong, but I'm interested. Why?   I think you're right, but prisoners usually marry women, don't they?
Don't count on it. Republicans do not believe in equality, individual freedom, or human rights. They only kowtow to their religious right masters. If Republicans trully belived in individual freedom, equality, and human rights the would wholeheartedly support this legislation.
People with big egos have libidos that keep up. what's new? It's an unfortunate accompanying characteristic.   The only reason that this was even posted was because it was another attempt to discredit anyone that is against gay marriage. The fact that most politicians cheat isn't a revelation.
Read what i actually wrote for a change Yank.
You claim god is unknowable (partially or otherwise, it does not matter).   You claim to know something of the unknowable, thus, you make a self-contradictory statement. Again. For what...the third time? Drop it, you're arguing illogically and I'm embarassed for you.
So you've got nothing to offer but a whining rant? Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean that the evidence doesn't exist.   By the way, why don't you offer some reliable evidence to support your foolish claims above. Creationist web sites don't do it for me. Peer reviewed literature please.
Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.
Ah, I see.   Your reasons are secret reasons. On a debate forum, about gay rights, you oppose it based on....well you won't say! Nice debate.   Who's really playing the game here?   I have already listed on a number of posts why it's not constitutional.   Since you missed it (It's only the first post in the thread)   For gay coupes right to be married (Or the same legal status)   1. Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender.   2. It's a contract between two consenting adults.   3. A contract that does not violate anyone's legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare.   It's unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights (hetero couples only), and not allow it to female/female and male/male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers. It's now a public issue on a significant scale.   Of course, maybe if you had a REASON for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage, we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim, but why your reason is also not constitutional.   You can call it games, I call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights, such as yourself, really can't make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights, other than saying "well I want to"...or in your case... "shhh...it's a secret".   You know what WE call it on the debate forum when one side refuses to present or rebut arguments? Losing the debate. I realize winning and losing..i.e. being right and being wrong are not concepts found in religion, where anything goes...but out here in the real world actions have consequences, and words...yes, imagine that, have specific meanings. You verbally support a movement that restricts human rights, yet won't give us reasons for your position. I find that appalling. Yet you are content with labeling me as "playing games". How ironic.   -Mach
Maryland already has the law on the books. It's effect thus far has only been to eliminate certain makes and models from the Maryland marketplace and to extinguish the sale of certain collectables.
So if it can be operated by means other than human control, are you saying a dog can operate it, maybe a monkey, thats something we see everyday. You are trying to split hairs Penfold, for a gun to be fired weather robotically, or training a primate to fire one still requires human intervention, so stop acting stupid because you are not stupid.
Talking about traitors, brady you are IT. Meanwhile on the other board you started previous to cutting and running like the coward you obviously are, Bryan posted a challenge to you. If you choose to accept the challenge which I have money that you do not accept, (so don't dissapoint me), be sure to read his guidelines so you will not make strawman arguments and red herring arguments. I am betting you cannot carry on a sustained debate without falling flat on your face
And more people have died from anti-gun Senator Ted Kennedy's driving than will ever die from my AR-15.
Answers include but are not limited to:   • People need a solution for the Problem of Evil.   • People want to have an "objective" standard for good and evil.   • God said it, I believe it, that settles it.
We DID learn about selective hearing in health class.
Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage. So by all means don't marry a man and the problem is solved.
Oh, well, that convinces me.
Such black and white thinking places the Supreme Court and the NRA at one time in the category of gun banners. The Supreme Court stated that only firearms in common use receive Second Amendment protection. The NRA once supported a ban on Saturday Night Specials:   "Viewed realistically, junky .22 handguns that retail for as little as $7.98 . . . aren't suited for target shooting, handgun hunting, or police or protection purposes. Most honest-to-goodness gun owners wouldn't have one around. Yet the reckless use of such junk has harmed legitimate firearms ownership."   -"Restraint on TV, Cheap Handguns Wins Favor," American Rifleman, (March 1968)   "On the Saturday Night Special, we are for it [banning] 100 percent. We would like to get rid of these guns."36   -NRA Executive Vice President Maxwell Rich, Senate Hearings on Saturday Night Special Ban, (September 13, 1971)
So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage.
oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.
Oh, but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant.
Is that a threat?
You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime?? wow, sounds like a liberal to me..
I dunno. Those Priuses are so small inside and out. How much explosive compound could Hasan fit into the thing and still be able to get in and drive it?
Of course, when wabbit says "dishonesty," he means "oversimplification"; the NMSR webpage is clearly designed for the layperson, not the geneticist. When he says "scientist," he means "shameless hack." Spetner argued that this is not an example of an increase in information until he had it repeatedly and undeniably shown to meet Spetner's own definition of information. Only now has he said, "Okay, so it's an increase, therefore it's not random." Classic moving the goalposts syndrome.   But if wabbit would like to continue leaning on Spetner as a "reliable source," I won't stop him. More fun for me.
OH! And I just finished breakfast...   Can anyone say, "Fly By!"
Could it partially be the fact that they don't want antiquated belief system dogma making their decisions? Must have access to a sonogram sounds like a lobby group attempting to sway opinion while enhancing revenue. Does the legislation force pregnant women who have not chosen abortion to have a sonogram? Raising children creates post-delivery stress syndrome.
And you can be described as a "pre-dead corpse" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???   Golly gee. Scared already?   Ah, so the dictionary is the ultimate authority? And all the way down to the 5th definition no less? New name for you: "Dictionary boy." Thanks for demonstrating that you really are nothing but a sophist (Go look THAT up in your precious dictionary).
So, by your logic, if there's a bad cop in New York, then all the cops in Boise, Idaho must be bad as well.
Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?
Well feel free to disprove evolution anytime.
Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you
Nothing like quoting experts willing to stick their scientific necks out, huh?   Or in your second quote:   "But it now appears the warming from greenhouse gases has been offset by a strong cooling effect from dimming - in effect two of our pollutants have been cancelling each other out.   This means that the climate may in fact be more sensitive to the greenhouse effect than previously thought."   Huh?
So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.   And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. "POOF! Goddidit!" And so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place? Why didn't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he didn't like out of existance? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson? Sure worked. First thing Noah did was to get drunk.
I see, we just keep on adding legs until they match. BTW, they walk on those "jumping" legs also. Why are they not refered to as "Walking/Jumping" legs.   However, if you feel you need to conqure another contradiction, here's a couple more.   How long did Jesus stay ressurected? Luke says one day, Acts says Forty days.   ------------------------------------------------   Using a literal reading and the Gospels, recreate a timeline of the crucifixion of Jesus.
Atheism is for cynical, self-righteous twits
So all the creatures you see today came about suddenly and fully formed?   And you observed this?   If this happened, the only one who couldobserve it is God.
Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion.
How about a sin tax of $100 dollars each time you log on and $10 dollars a word for each time you speak one?   It's fair because it would help pay for all the lying propaganda damage you do to society. Rights come with responsibilities.   On guns, no can do. SCOTUS has ruled many times that a right freely stated in the Constitution cannot be compelled to purchase a license nor a fee to exercise.   NEXT!
So montalban. Why don't you tell us about creationism. What is the theory? What is the evidence? What predictions can be made.   We can assume that since you haven't responded to previous requests that there is no theory and no evidence. It is only superstition based on childish mythology.
But they consider the exact same thing inside a human that has yet to be implanted a pregnancy?   Double standards much?
You think its bad now? Watch what happens if Gov't takes control. I saw a great tagline the other day, it said "If the US get socialized medicine where will Canadians get healthcare?"   Anyone who doesn't like insurance premiums is free not to pay them, at least until the gov't takes over.   Happy New Year
And where exactly is your proof that "Stop, don't touch, leave the area, tell an adult" is indoctrination and translates to "go out and buy a gun, buy as many guns as possible, obsess over the gun, etc."
So the radiometric data stand: the Earth, moon, and older meteorites are all 4 or so billion years old, not just a few thousand.   Changing Decay Rates?   Another Creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young-Earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant, thereby throwing a monkey wrench into the calculations. There are at least two problems with this argument.   First, it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object. Remember, for example, the oldest exposed rocks on earth, dated using different parent radioisotopes? All five of the decay sequences (Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, U-Pb, Th-Pb, and Lu-Hf) clustered right around 3.7 billion years. If decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years, why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results?   Second, radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions. In chemistry, the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in a number of ways, such as by changing the temperature, acidity, pressure, or reactant concentrations. Such changes, however, have essentially no effect on nuclear decay. In fact, experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made, but failed.
So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?
And it is heat that resets the clock. Thus it is volcanic rock and ash that can be dated most reliably.
you mean like partially pregnant or almost pregnant or almost a virgin?   I don't have a beef with God, I only pick on guys shorter or weaker than I.
Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about.
Well is this serious science or is this ring-around-the-rosie on Sesame Street?   Am I just supposed to play make-believe and/or use my imagination? I can do that -- for instance, when I play with my kids, I'm real good at playing the role of "Ken" when we imagine that "Barbie goes to the beach" Surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not.   I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge. He says the following about gradualism:   ----------------------------------------   Change in this manner (gradualism) is just not found in the fossil record. pg. 48   Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured. pg. 52   Darwin's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual, progressive change in the fossil record was faulty. pg. 53   As we have seen in the previous chapter, the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual, steady process of adaptive change. And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view. pg. 57   We're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual, progressive, adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence. pg. 57   ------------------------------------   I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate. It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed. (do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring?)   It seems butterflies have this same ability.....Evolution sure is amazing!   For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.   "Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again," she said   http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm
So when your God killed all of the helpless, little first borns in Egypt he too was another baby-killing liberal? You are very amusing and naive.
Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that "informed" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution.
This one certainly seems to be out of context, as reading a mere 2 verses farther yields the statement that "[Menahem] did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.   Are you then suggesting that what Menahem did was wrong? I would agree. And so, apparently, does God.
Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells "tuned" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can "figure out" what wavelength is entering our eyes.   http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htm   Does this dispell your confusion?   Edit:   And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye. That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye.
And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.
And you think the British would do that?
Oh? And what is the specific amount of pot you have to smoke before you become a drug crazed fiend?
Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers).
You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?
Yea, and so is gardening. Both are "murdering" living things. Both do not mentally exist. A strand of DNA is the only difference, which isn't very much.
Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.
Interesting sigline. Let?s explore it further.   So, if I?m a woman working in a high crime area of a city at night and carry a handgun for my protection because I?m only 5? tall and 100 pounds and couldn?t engage in hand-to-hand combat with a 250 pound assailant, I?m a coward?
Looks like you're not asking for objections to the conclusions and analysis this time around, like you were here. I guess it is wise only to argue on the grounds you know your opponent will find the most irritating or difficult.   At any R.A.T.E. (ha ha ha...), I'll repeat the objections raised on the old forum, which move to doubt the sufficiency of the empirical data:   From http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq...1_1/Helium.htm:   "Thus our new diffusion data support the main hypothesis of the RATE research initiative: that God drastically accelerated the decay rates of long half-life nuclei during the earth's recent past."   The empirical data is missing, Zero. The problem with the empirical data in support of the above statement, is that it does not exist.
Is this a rational statement? If so, prove it rationally, by science.
This should be in the science section, not the CvE section. Don't give SS any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology.
Since I don't believe believe that everything had a common ancestor , a rock , I consider all ancient reptiles dinosaurs. If that is incorrect in your book so be it. We are not debating the definition of dinosaurs.
Then argue with yourself. Why bother having others answer for themselves
Yes. What would a former Archbishop of Canterbury know about Christianity?
So the police can be there instantly if you have an intruder? They can respond before you even call them? Wow, you have some fast-responding police! That's fine if that's what you want. But I'd prefer take personal responsibility for myself and my family, thank you, rather than trust the police who may or may not be reliable, trustworthy, and likely won't be there fast enough to stop an attack before it happens.
And I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.
Crammed with them, sure, why not? It's easy, only a few million light years. The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too.
yes, we will send you to the camps and all of us will gather in our black robes and dance around a fire while we make you dig ditches.
and for you MIT stat loving freaks: http://web.mit.edu/~noto/Public/bk_v8.pdf
Yep when about 99.99% of a cows diet is grass...I guess we should be eating that instead.   It is hard to urinate in one corner of the toilet. If all ground that is being used for livestock is "wonderfully transformed" into grain production there will be many many wild species that will go extinct due to lack of uncultivated land.
Well, thank you for the riveting example of Poe's law in action.   Parody or actual argument? Only the poster knows for sure.
Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.
That's so trite that it is meaningless.
Come on, now. You're talking about a city where the dead vote in every election.
We've answered these questions already over and over again and you'll get the same ones as well.
What if a 13 year old girl comes up to you and asks for sex, and you agree? Are you forcing yourself on to her?
So you plan to move out of N.Y.in a year or two,and own a gun?why not now?N.Y.laws are sticker than most,but not all.You want to teach your kids to shoot?Better do it now,later on it will probably be harder.   Well if you don't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own guns,but yet you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits,thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun.   I may be wrong but is anyone saying or implying total gun freedom?   What we are saying is, to many laws on it no more.   35-40 years ago we didn't have all this B.S.about it,you wanted a gun you went and got one (in other words very readily available)   Walk down the street with one and you didn't have a S.W.A.T.team on you.   We have seen to many gun rights taken so yeah every time a new policy or   amendment comes along we are antsy about it.   So if you support every amendment made to the constitution pertaining to guns, than I submit your not to interested in owning a gun.   And for the record:gun toting bandits(out here we say bandito's)are jumping   out of every ally{figuratively speaking}.But the pro-gunners know that if the   anti-gunners had their way,only the bandito's have guns.
So what? How long did the idea of magical creation out of nothing in 6 days hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically?
Well I suppose I could've always put up a sign that said "Trespassers will be held with legal counsel, robbers will be shot, survivors will be shot again" but you're just welcoming trouble with that.
Well, that is the argument that one hears from creationists so often. So when are you going to get to the most delicious, highly satisfying entertainment? Even more important, when are you going to expose the theory of evolution? YOu don't seriously propose that your little series of cow pies is actually meaningful, do you?
Actually, that honour is reserved for the usual representations of those who advocate young earth creationism.
And that's why I think you are a troll. There really aren't any experts here. There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind.
And that is more likely than a magical being who poofed everything from nothing, don't you agree?
Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste.
You mean like allowing for, and funding, comprehensive sex education, birth control, and parenthood planning? Those things alone would reduce the number of abortions significantly.   However, we live in a nation that would fire a Surgeon General for stating that masturbation is healthy. We live in a nation that believes that sex is only of the penis-vaginal penetration variety. We live in a nation where most pregnancy are unplanned. We're so busy "protecting' our children, that we don't realize that the best protection is information.
You know what? You're starting to remind me an awful lot of reverend Jackson and reverend Phlaeger (the one who said they were going to kill anyone that didn't support their ideas of gun control). The claimed that a gun shop owner was intentionally violating the laws of Chicago and selling all kinds of weapons to gang members, simply by being one mile outside of the Chicago city limits.   Your entire argument is that since there are firearms dealers within a certain distance to the Mexico/America border, then they must obviously be outfitting the mexican drug cartels.   You've hung yourself with this article you just posted, and I'm gonna explain why. The ATF has said there are 6,700 licensed dealers along the border, meaning they know exactly where they are. So why exactly isn't the ATF going in there and breaking them up for their illegal activities? After all if close proximity is an unquestionable sign of guilt, then the ATF must know that these guys are equipping mexican drug cartels with fully automatic machine guns (the kinds that the American people can't ever get) and grenades and rocket launchers, and maybe even the odd nuclear warhead.   The ATF shut down Red's Trading Shop on matters as insignificant as typos. So why aren't they going in and shutting down these rogue dealers if they're doing anything wrong? It's illegal to own an automatic weapon of any sort without a federal tax stamp, and it's not possible for civilians to own post-'86 model automatic weapons, so why isn't the ATF doing something about it if they're breaking the laws?   Seriously Aussie, what is it, is the ATF saying "We know they're breaking the laws, but they're not doing anything illegal we can bust them on"?
You're right it'll be fighting the war in Iraq. )Nah, really it'll be from social security, etc etc.
Showing the RIDICULOUS nature of some gun laws! Even the Antis can't (or maybe won't) obey them! Ridiculous paperwork traps that even caught and surprised the Queen of gun control!   If they had arrested her, they would have gotten a Real criminal off the streets and NOW our society would have finally been safe! Ridiculous!   But it was a good thing for her, that Bloomburg and his Illegal Mayors weren't around when she broke America's gun laws!
How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.
So if Jitobear's mother had the option to abort Jitobear in utero, you want Jitobear to have the same option with any children she carries? That's awfully progressive of you.
And why not? After all, Grimm's Fairy Tales is a wonderful read and who can deny the happiness Santa brings to 2nd graders? What's a bit more fantasy gonna hurt?
Actually he is, and he's posted on this thread.   It is a pity that you're unwilling to debate, but endeavour a smear campaign as you did on the Science and Math posts. I would advise you read the above quote before talking again
Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile.
well that won't help you when you go to hell...Woo hoo
Methinks that our friend supersport has been reading too much of the Animorphs book series (which was very popular among my two children) - I wouldn't put it past him to try to use something like that to produce the case.
Really! Why not? I'm very interested.
I take it you have no understanding of science, much less the scientific method?
I think you could teach gun-control at a gun-free school, too.   Sex-education is also taught in schools that forbid their pupils to couple on the school yard .
They're going after retailers selling ones that don't. Duh!
Again, as an ignorant layman, I can only get the gist of this material, but how anyone could possibly argue against the genetic code as a product of intelligent design is beyond me.
Gee the thimble wearing comic relief slides in.
I see you know nothing about the subject...hardly a surprise.
Ha, that is just an idiotic perspective. We'd have no laws (and many important ones) if you can't make a bill that doesn't affect you. Sorry Civil Rights legislation!
Minor quibble. Omnipotence merely means that a being is capable of all things. It states nothing about how awkward or difficult these things are. Making a galaxy may require some serious brainsweat, whilst making a person may not...   Anyway, besides that I agree with you!
So, evolution is falsified because Ford didn't draft chimps to work the assembly lines?   I've never seen such nonsense paraded about with such pride. I'd congratulate you on your win DamEtel, but I'm more impressed with your patience.
Oh no, it's not too complex for us to understand. So please explain to we simpletons how Intelligent Design is nothing more than animism. But first, here is the truth regarding this newest perverse propaganda you are promoting.
I thought you said that you had been following the converstaion. I guess you didn't understand any of it.
Women's rights actually exist, unlike the Christian God.
Way to go NRA,makes um look good ya know,kinda like they can give a little here and there.
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/ma...27tools-t.html   In other words, a lot of these kids never grow up.   And then they get guns.   And, did I mention the hormone was testosterone?
and she would have been better by aborting the baby? That makes no sense. Instead of seeing your baby die naturally you would rather not look and kill it yourself. The same person died no matter how you look at it.
Don't get me wrong sleazyrider I love babies, they're delicious!
So your saying I have no right to disagree unless I can prove and refute evolution and science. Right, you can come back down to earth now. I can disagree with what I want to and no one an explanation, however that wasn't my intent.   [quote]You have the right to defend yourself, but when you resort to comments such as "get a life" to socialist, we start (or merely confirm our existing notions) that you no idea what you are talking about when you disagree with science and evolution.[quote/]   Oh you mean this comment from Socialist, "I am not considering your points anymore, so In a way I am. I just like making fun of them. It's entertaining".   It's funny how you forgot to include his comment. What scientific answer would you have me give?
You throw personal insults more than I do. So when will YOU grow up?
To me, your point would be easier to decipher if you made a long story short.   I'd rather read your point of view on the subject, without reading a mini -series of someone who wan't me to feel sorry for them.   Do people who choose to have an abortion expect a welcoming committee?
If our guns are mearly popguns as you just described them, then why do you want to take them from us so badly. Maybe you are considering a life of crime as a carrer, and your afraid of being shot, is that whats really going on here.
Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?
Yes they sure will.... with what 776 accidental deaths last year due to guns as opposed to 3,402 accidental drownings seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns. But if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole (literary form of exageration to express a point) I will try in the future to keep it down to your level.
Oh, I don't know. Grow food in a garden, gather it from various wild sources, hunt game animals in the forest.
But I suppose the Pope is going to hell   Here is a link to a website that has a brief list of translational fossils, there are gaps but that could mean that we have yet to find those fossils, or we have found them but no one has made the link yet.   You also keep stating that evolution is theory, we all agree it is still a theory but it is the most plausible theory that fits the evidence found that Evolution is the most likely mechanism to explain that we have lots of different species, to condense it to the real basics just think of it as the ancestry of the species.(Apologies for condensing the Theory into those small sentences could be here forever explaining Evolution )   N.B Evolution does not mention how life started, there is another Scientific Theory on the Origin of life on Earth, but I can not think of it at this moment.   Hunter it is really not good form on a message board when debating a subject to say someone is going to hell because they don't agree with your viewpoint, present your evidence why you believe that evolution is incorrect and we can have a proper debate.
Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.
Really? So, university presidents and trustees -- the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection with evolution, and most of whom are considerably more politically conservative than university faculties -- are behind the whole thing? Wow.   You know, this sort of claim requires evidence. I would like see your evidence of university administration involvement. Got any?   And who are the "top" in the peer-review process? Editors? Please explain what you mean.
Most of the laws of the Peoples Republic of Kalifornia are aimed at rendering the citizens into prey. You can't point to many that don't. Self defense is not allowed there I am afraid.
I think it is hilarious that you still think that in order to do a detailed study of evolution, you have to read 10 different books on it and take brainwashing classes from a university. Maybe you just like making yourself feel superior to me...who knows...
the cricket in the pliers feels pain...   When you start to squeeze a cricket with a pair of pliers, it starts to wiggle and tries to get away so as not to get crushed by the pliers. Is it because the cricket feels pain?
So, you are talking an incredibly expensive drug that MAY work 20% of the time when it is used.   Are they just letting these people die....giving them morphine for the pain and letting them waste away?   No
Translation: we let you work and we let you vote, even though you let us down ('This is because of imperfection ...'); so even though 'men are not without blame too', the Fall is mainly your fault, so accept your inferior status and PIPE DOWN!   Now, any guesses as to what organs thinking_person thinks with? Clue: they're not above his waist.
You mean "No! sex" , 'til you want *response-ably* to nurture a baby. What novel ideas!
Yours.   ..........
I don't give a damn about the circumstances of the unborn either(obvious here I am not saying I don't care what happens to either, but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this is my stance). Neither one should have a right to kill the other...and for that matter, no one else should be allowed to come up and murder the women or the unborn. So my views are still treating them as equals.   and I will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you can't prove.
What a trite statement.
and a brain with no body kept on life support is only a brain...no person. If beg the question here. I deny that a level of intelligence is needed to deserve rights. I disagree that what you can do is a requirement..only what you are (that being a human).   Still, I quoted you as saying "a basic human fundamental right"...I am not sure what this right is or where it comes from or why it is fundamental or why it only applies to the humans you think it should apply to. Perhaps we should restrict it to only white folks again...after all, white folks are the only humans with white skin which makes them different from all other wildlife...right?
Have you lost your mind? I got no idea what you are talking about.
So Bush is responsible for the death of Third World mothers now?! Get real! There are billions of people on this planet, chose another vilian for a change.
Yes, amazing, how they weren't people before.
So both daughters get daddy ******, shag him and get pregnant. And considering that God smites people for just about anything and everything in the Bible, he seems silently approving in this case.
Like, I said, I can't take men's position on abortion seriously b/c they can spout off all they want; however their viewpoint must be affected somewhat by the fact that they will never actually have to make the decision themselves.   As far as circumcision...um...who cares?  J/k. I really don't know what to think about that. Never given it alot of thought, as I've never had a penis, don't plan on growing one, and therefore I can't have a valid point of view. Do whatever feels best to you. Get my drift?   Hey, you two, Clerisian and Steeeve, quit arguing semantics. Geesh!
So where will you be moving to?
Oh God no. If there is anything more boring than twits talking, its twits
My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.
Great idea. Explain why all the tests that prove it wrong are irrelevant.
Less than a playstation, of course!
Except that that would be the author's words, not a direct quote. Notice the absence of quotation marks? Special Agent Newell never said "17% came from the US". The author has as much trouble with the stats as you. 17% of the total have been traced to the US. We don't know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the US but is untraced or untraceable. See the difference?
Yep it is easy. Lizards didn't evolve an avian lung.   This should be easy for the creationist:   The avian lung is far more efficient than the mammalian lung. Why didn't your god therefore fit the superior lung design to mammals, especially that apparent "special creation", us humans? Also please explain why he fitted a superior eye design to squid and octupuses than what he fitted to all vertibrates.   Once you have answered these two easy questions, I've a few hundred more for you
Chalk it up to the fact that -- although not all the time -- a good part of the time, the same people are pretty anti-anything education. We shouldn't expect them to argue positions that make sense.
Oh, I get it. So you believe, but you don't exactly "believe".
8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.   This may be true because you cant chance your height...but let me tell you...   hanging around jack asses will make you a jack XXX
But what if it is unconstitutional, like Prop. 8?   No, it doesn't.   Are you saying homosexuals aren't American? Are you saying that more of gay's right should be stripped, including that of protest? How dare them fight for their own freedoms? I should lend you my time machine, and you should go tell this to Malcom X.   And you still haven't responded to my post.
Many of the Christian denominations are ignoring them the same way they ignore the prohibitions against pork, mixed cloth, and stoning your children to death because they sass you.
Okay Yankee Fan. Keep pretending that it doesn't. Well, if you never read the article, you wouldn't be pretending as that would be an argument from position of ignorance.
Well, as we can see from other recent posts, your reading comprehension is below high school level.   I don't get it. Why do folks think lying enhances their POV?
So, you're just an anti-geologist, anti-cosmologist, anti-archaeologist, anti-physicist, and probably a few more that I can't be arsed to think of right now. *shrugs* Might as well get it over with and just say you're an anti-science religious nutter.
I'd love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all Deities. Especially the Deistic Gods. And I'd love to see how science is suppose to disprove a being that is not bound by logic, reason or any laws. What science can do is disprove that God was directly responsible for this or that, the sun rising, the rain season, etc. Did you perhaps realize that many scientists are Buddhists because Buddhism which has beings that behave as Gods with such powers and exist partially within the natural and supernatural? Or are you again assuming all religions don't exist except for Christanity?
And YET! The good mayor has the time, money, and extra man power to go to other cities and look for crimes?   Heck. I have been to New York, and he has an awful lot of nerve going anywhere else looking for crimes to solve. And what criminal enterprises has the people of his good city people supplied other cities with. I mean besides the crimes his investigators committed. Drugs, thugs, and murderers to name a few.   Bloomberg, stay the heck where you belong!
So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?
OH GOODY! Another meaningless quote.
Which wouldn't make a darn bit of difference - apart from the tiny matter of women dying and suffering permanent harm, but don't let that bother you. you'll also have to amend the constitution to remove any references to bodily autonomy. get ready to donate your kidney!
This brings up an interesting point, and that is that science is extremely limited. Using your logic, persons should not have believed in the fact that the earth is a round object floating in space before it was proven scientifically, even though it was a fact then, as it is now. This fact was written about in scripture long before science "proved" it, just as the description of the hydrological system was described in scripture long before scientists figured it out. THIS is where the evidence can be found for the validity of the Bible. When you find scripture after scripture of historical fact and scientific reference that is found to be accurate, you should tend to take is seriously. The problem with science is its arrogance. It's inability to see that truth can be found in other areas is a real handicap. Add to that theories like evolution that disguise themselves as science, and you have a real problem.   One does not stand on a train track with a train barreling down on them to "prove" they will die. This "fact" is usually taken to be reliable, even though that person hasn't "proven" it to be true through experimentation. If you need scientific proof for everything you believe, you have a real problem. If this were the case, no legal decision on guilt or innocence could be rendered in a court room, since the decision is usually rendered based on the preponderance of the evidence related to a crime that was commited in the past. We have the same problem with the origin of life and evolution of species - macro changes that supposedly occured in the past. As such, every availble form of investigation should be followed up on. This includes metaphysical possibilities. They can be investigated just as evolution is, buy the study of history, manuscripts, archeological methods and statistical and prophetic evidences. Both scientists and creationists are talking about investigation to find truth, and to self limit your investigative techniques is not only reckless, but might be a form of self delusion. Requiring truth to conform to your standards, as scientists of the past did, can either cause great delay in finding truth, or cause you to miss it entirely.
And of course, the theory of gravity isn't "physically" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the "Out of Africa" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense.
Yes. It's part of this massive conspiracy. We're trying to thin out your population so we can take Australia for our own.
He wasn't discussing abortion nor was He promoting it. He was declaring war on an unclean people whom He commanded the Jews to wipe out in a time of WAR. Again you rip an event out of context and attempt to imply God was endorsing abortion.
Argh. Atheism is no belief in a god, "without belief in god". Why would you try to prove a negative? Did you wake up today and believe in a UNI because you couldn't prove it didn't exist?   Richbee has a long way to go to "prove" anything other than his fondness for rhetoric.   -Mach
So students don't deserve their constitutional rights?
Wrong. It was Soviet women. The USSR no longer exists. Unless you believe that those godless commies are just playing possum?
You jsut don't get it. You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not. What part of that do you not understand. You say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. How cruel can you be
yeah ok buddy. Just because you can not figure out what those little numbers on the end of the things I have posted nor simply because you lack the mental fortitude to look back to some of my older posts or click and R*E*A*D the links to see that I have indeed provided ample backing does not mean that I haven't been doing MY job.   Now do you have anything of substance to add "Tim"?   "Futue te et ipsum caballum tuum"
what other forest? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world, and it would be what, the size on central park?
So, if a baby is having trouble breathing that's been born already, you don't consider it a 'person'? Methinks you've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all.
Yes that actually did happen. And knowing our nanny state government where anything that could cause harm is banned we have it banned.   BTW do any of you know of some great airsoft fields over in USA?
I think this post pretty much sums up the depths of your prejudice, and the thoroughness of your ignorance.   A child should endure physical abuse before being allowed to be adopted by a loving gay couple?   Being abused physically is preferential to being adopted by a loving gay couple?   I always have to chuckle when people are so eager to reveal their prejudices in such a way that demonstrates they are completely non-credible as any type of character witness...
Come back when you learn the difference between climate and weather.
Just so we're clear here, your idea of "proving your point" that I'm dishonest is to call me dishonest.   Yeah, not quite how it works outside of Archie-land. Sorry.
Traitor? More like the boy wised up on the matter.   So, Brady, how's it feel to have all your work and hopes destroyed in the blink of an eye? How does it feel to know that your last best hope for a disarmed society has abandoned you by the side of the road, and you're now out of options and the only thing left to do is eat the crow?
Well that explains your anger.   I hope you are blessed with homeliness. Makes your commitment easier to keep. How old are you now?
Actually there is one other point of view. The "Don't Care What the Bible Says" one.

True, but nobody suggested there was such a grey area.   We accept your word.   I have never seen this, do you have examples?   So far as I am aware, nobody but you believes this to be the case.[/QUOT   ET phone home, fed-ex just delivered your case of 9mm shells lol.
Well maybe that will teach him to get a education for once. Still, my analogy is quite true.   Furthermore both words are meant by creationists to argue evolution is faith. Dishonest, but that is essentialy the mantra of creationism.   "Lie, cheat, steal and fabricate to get people to be believe."
Oh well thats tough hat to victims of rape then.   Somehow I doubt this will survive legal challenges, assuming Gov.Rounds actually signs the Bill.
No, billsco, I've never had an insight which would reveal the creationist mindset in the way you describe: I wouldn't mind seeing an occasional imp or two on my ceiling.   I've also wondered (like Waxy) about the motives of the scientists who at first patiently, and then satirically, address the "arguments" of the religious enthusiasts who so desperately want to trash evolution. Are the resident biologists performing an altruistic service or just entertaining spectators like me ?
You mean like they are happy wile having sex?
And I suppose they are also responsible for the evolution of utterly insane mental cases such as yourself? And for electing GBII. And for Saddam Hussein. And for the drought in the South currently. And for cancer and AIDS. And heck why stop there why not for the Devil himself. All those sodomites must have become the original demons in hell I suppose.

Does this seem a little ironic to anyone else? Either becoming intoxicated is acceptable or it isn't, why does the method make one acceptable and practitioners of the other "losers"? For the record I don't drink, smoke or partake of illegal drugs.
My my, did someone get up on the wrong side of the bed or what, of course you realize that you just gave me the answer I was looking for, not that I didnt already know the answer, I just wanted you to say it. I dont believe I need a clue, so I will let you have it instead Brady.
Now, I could ask the same thing.
I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?
Except that it does nothing of the sort... But then, what can we expect from somebody citing a website trying to sell you liquid vitamin supplement...   Nevertheless, we look into the Pottenger's cats claim.   Here is a page called, "Lesson of the Pottenger's Cats Experiment: cats are not humans." Although it's a page aimed at explaining why this "experiment" is not applicable to humans, it exposes the other, erm, flaws in this experiment. The one striking me based on the wikipedia list of diets for the groups should be obvious to everyone: many of these cats were being deprived of protein. This page confirms and elaborates. In fact, its first point is that today's cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today's cooked food. The difference is that good owners don't feed their pets deficient diets.   The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport's Lamarckism. In order for supersport to be supported, the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids. Obviously, they did not. The only thing we see here is the effect of poor (i.e. positively malnutritive) diet.   We can conclude that supersport's Morton's demon is pretty much in full control. There's no other explanation for somebody seeing this experiment and thinking it supports Lamarckism, or even counters evolutionary theory, even if he doesn't know the basics of experimentation and nutrition.
Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact.
So you actually know enough, you can see the beginning and end of time, you know what is inside each and every individual on the planet so much so that you can say God is wrong to do any given act?   How is this possible oh great and mighty oz?
So can women can cure themselves? Is that what you mean? Or do you mean that once they forgive themselves they can move on to help other women do the same?   thanks in advance...

Well, both traffic in waste material. Many traps are present in each for them to function properly. And don't forget where biological evolution and plumbing both lead you--into a cesspool.
So you agree that it's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against a criminals. Good we can agree on at least one thing.
Well all you have to do is tell us the minimum time during which it could happen by NDS theory and then how long it actually took and we can compare the numbers. Of course you will have to detail how you arrived at both sets of numbers. Enjoy
Actually, shootings happen because a person points a firearm at someone and pulls the trigger. This is illegal. You can't make it more illegal than it already is.   Shootings do not happen because of gun happy nuts running around. Nobody has ever been injured anywhere by any gun happy nut running around. Many have been injured by criminals who disobey the law.   As far as puncture wounds, do stabbings count?   Or, as it appears, are you only concerned with those caused by firearms?
And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am. However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice. Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment.
So your biased reading of the Bible coupled with your personal flaws and your misunderstanding of science is the basis of your religiosity? Somehow I don't think that's something you'd really want to brag about...
Well lets speculate about how many possible explanations we could concoct if left to supposition. I'm talking about the only two explanations for the origins of life that have ever been entertained as viable empirically testable concepts in modern science.
I think that I don't have quite enough Tobasco in my Bloody Mary.

So Starguy since you are obviously afraid of guns and won't go near, you don't have to worry about any"violent testosterone's" but if you want to be friendlier   well you know how to do it. OUCH.
Oh yeah and did i forget to mention. How in the world do you get off saying I'm a liar? by the time im twenty two i will have accomplished so much more than you have. You pedegouge/scholars mistake being intellectual with blending in with everyone else. Try and stand out from the croud next time.
Well, you have proven yoruself to be a man with no brain, that is for sure.   The definition that was given was the one that scientists use, not the layperson.
It's kind of funny that they claim this happened, but can't get the woman to come out and say it?
So,are you saying that all anti-gunners are fearless???   If so,,I must laugh.
Well when the second amendment was written, "modern military weapons" were black powder rifles. Feel free to defend yourself with black powder rifles. In addition, what are the non-recreational benefits of guns. In other words, what would we lose by taking away automatic guns (since I know your manly self could never part with every weapon you own.)
Over the Internet that can be a particularly difficult call...
Oh really? Gun ownership allowed these "lunatics" as you call them, to become government dictators? If I owned 50 guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition, you're saying I could run the government with an iron fist all by myself, just like that? Any random person can just appoint themselves God over the entire nation, without a single ounce of resistance just because they're armed?
Rather unsurprisingly, the U.S. constitution does not have any bearing on Australian law.

How would I fill in some of the gaps? Here was my sequence: something like unicellular life to multi-cellular life, random multi-cellular conglomerations to an amoeba, to a fish, to a dinosaur, to a mammal, to an ape, and finally to a man??
Archie, why should anyone even bother with you? You ask someone to explain polystrate fossils-three people do. You plug your ears and go "la-la-la, I can't hear you", then demand that someone explain polystrate fossils. Someone else posts 100 categories of evidence against a global flood, and you wave it away as "evo lies". Yet you demand we take your biased site at face value.   I swear, you get dumber by the minute.
Oh, right. And what would yours be? "We the humble people of the human species have decided to break away from Britan rule and form our own bubble community. No one has any rights whatsoever, and we restrict our citizens to living in bubbles because we cherish each life, from skin cells to bacteria to plants to embryos. In fact, we really have no purpose in life, we just life to not kill other lives.
HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is.   6) And the standard "theistic evolution" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it.
Even the ones that are destined to go extinct without producing any "daughter" species? Apeart from that quibble though, you are right. But don't tell the creationsts; it'll only confuse them
But you debate with it?
Oh thats not politically kerect and secially wif the chosen one doing the world apology toure I don't see that going down.   Well lay a few on us sin baby. Give us the deal.
Because none of these issues were raised in the Heller case!   What's the matter with people like you! Your statement is like claiming that the Supreme Court obviously thinks abortion is alright because they didn't address the issue during the Heller case.

I disagree, it depends on the nature of insult.   "You suck! What kind of a dumb name is 'Robbie' anyway?" Hardly requires a stretching of the old grey matter. But the snappy one-liner and the witty retort, or just a carefully crafted insult all require a fair amount of intelligence and insight.   Flat out denial requires least thought. I.e. "you're wrong!", "you're wrong 'cos God says so!" "You're wrong 'cos Dawkins says so!
Not all threads need to be courttroom style debates. If you choose to aid in establishing a working consensus fine. If you want simply to rave and rant there are plenty of venues where you can do that. Your participation is welcome as long as you are a participant and are seriously trying to resolve the issue. Otherwise for heavens sake go do something else.

And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true. But that doesn't make mythology true.
So you still choose to believe that someone who's a victim of crime should be punished as if they committed the crime themselves?
Oh, it certainly is an issue. Martin Killias, a Swiss criminologist, did find a link between gun ownership and homicide in Switzerland. However, my point was to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulations. The law in Switzerland requires that military weapons kept in the home be unloaded and stored under lock and key.   I don't think Switzerland is a gun-nut utopia.
Jesus was a retarded ancient hippie who walked passed people who were starving and dying, yet didn't help them. Jesus is a man who ignored his family and considered his disciples family instead. Jesus is a man who didn't come to preach peace, but use a sword.   Jesus is a man who didn't repudiate much of the Old Testament atrocities. Jesus is bad, and Jesus is GOd, therefore God is bad. I don't care what the biblical stoner said.
Really?   If "nature" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been "eliminated" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your "individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type.   Even animals that have "normal" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor.   Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is "the standard" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is "natural" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a "greater purpose". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given "purpose" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was "made" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or "life", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water.
Not much of anything else either, it would seem.

And you don't actually see the circulariey in your position? The Bible is inspired by god because the Bible says that it is inspired by god. What if I wrote a book in which I declared that the book was inspired by god? Good for you? I'll do it if you give me the word.   And what about the Book of Mormon? Takes your book and goes one better. Also inspired by god because it says that it is inspired by god.

OMG Brady, he betrayed HIS PEOPLE? and I thought WE THE PEOPLE were his people.
Oddly enough, the Mass constitution reads:   Article XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it.   So apparently they came to their senses later.
Before you were claiming it was a slippery slope. Now you're claiming it's a strawman. Perhaps you don't understand what either term means.

So now you are saying that the earth doesn't move? I get it. The earth used to be fixed at the center of the universe when those Bible verses were written but God changed it. Now it orbits the sun like the other planets.   Actually, the verse does say that grasshoppers have four legs. There is no mention of jumping legs. You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish. When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error (4 legs on a grasshopper, sun at center of solar system, rabbits chewing cud, an unmoving earth) you add elements that aren't in the Bible and declare it without error.   You "interpret" and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it. You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational.

Oh? You worked on Bowling? When did the NRA and KKK ever burn a cross together? Hmmm? I can take a hint. Just something about that movie tells me Mike Moore is anti-gun.   Hey how about Chuck Hestons speech? Some how I got the impression he gave the speech in Denver? Did you? You know the 'from my dead hands speech'. Anyhow how did Chuck Heston get to wear TWO different suits from one speech?   Anyhow. If Mike Moore of Flint Michigan was behind that counter, would Mike Moore be alive? Survive with broken facial bones? Survive with internal injuries? Or overhelming beat his attacker that he survives unhurt and stopped his attacker?
Just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.

Shh shhh it's ok mellow mellow mellow. Relax you have managed to go from legalizing gay marriage to a collapse of our legal system and the downfall of man's ability to reason and govern himself in two paragraphs.   Maybe gay people would like to enjoy some of the happiness you get from your marriage and same as you that happiness is worth the oppressiveness incurred as a result.   You may have more in common with gay people than you think.

But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is. What it isn't is an explosion. I don't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang, have you?
Duh! You don't seem to have a grasp on what science is. Science isn't a search for truth. It is an attempt to explain observations naturalistic events without appeals to gods, angels, or demons.
Yes. it's called global dimming, and yes, I trust mainstream scientific organizations.   If you knew anything about science, scientists usuallyspeak in terms of COULDS, possibliites, and likely, because science isn't 100% and scientific facts aren't absolute. THey are largely evidence-supported conjectures. You can't prove anything 100%. They are giving reasonable estimates. That's how climatology works.

**   The "methodology" of science is not materialism/mechanism/darwinism, but simply empiricism leading inductively/abductively to hypotheses regarding regularities in causation in nature that can be tested via the predictive experimentation of the scientific method. Neither empiricism or the epistemological process of the scientific method are the exclusive property of materialism/mechanism, nor did they originate from within that metaphysic, despite the beliefs of materialist/mechanists to that effect.   Unfortunately, some 150 years ago, that methodology was set aside, and has remained out of sight, with regard to the hypothesis that is generally referred to as 'darwinism'.
Well said. It is a disgrace that the "Flat Earth" side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the "Spontaneous Creation" side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects. Do you realise that they refuse to present the "Cheese" side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days? It's outrageous, how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue!

Bingo. Old fossils can be corrupted (contaminated, to be precise) by contacting anything from human skin to pollen in the air. This would add a relatively large amount of carbon to the fossil and would indicate that the fossil is recent.

Because his, as a Christian, doesn't follow the Christian Bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does.   "Quote mine" - looks like that will be a common acusation here. If I keep things concise and readable, I'm quote mining. That quote wasn't about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, it was about atheists being comfortable with theistic evolution, far more than "believers" (creationists)   And that didn't have a thing to do with my point.   Again, it was irrelevent to my point. Atheists believe the only source of truth is secular - it goes without saying.   No, Lewontin didn't say to give people the power to discover the truth, he's saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to "correct" sources of truth. Read note #47 for chapter 6. Miller didn't misinterpret him at all. In note #47, Lewontin even mentioned the NY Times!   Because there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin's book is required reading in public schools. We have to more and more, as atheism is established.   It's a deal, if you'll put a hold on lecturing me about reading comprension as you ignore very relevant notes in the rear of the book.   The one where he bragged about defeating Henry Morris, a Christian? (pp 172, 173)   Sure they were, Christians are always opposing Christianity! All they have to do is claim to be a Christian, and there's no way they could be a false teacher!   And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible.   Even though the Bible says God did. His understanding of the Bible is very undeveloped and limited.   So you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about "preachers", he wasn't referring to priests? I've seen it all now.   As I said, I hope to learn if all theistic evolution does not believe in original sin. I'd like to know if all Catholics believe the creation story is nothing but a fairy tale.
And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples' lives as well? What? you don't do that? Bull. You can't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does. But by your logic, that would be imposing on them.   Sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt. Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.
So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.
Well, either the real or imaginary Phyllis implied those things in the post under discussion.
I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger, another police official said.   How is anyone to learn any potential of a firearm if it is to be locked away and not seen?   Besides that little piece about lacking awareness I don't really buy it.   A gun death is a gun death, whoever pulls the trigger?Serious question, Penfold,   and I will even dispense with the COMRADE,are you a plant just to get people going?or did you actually have someone close to you hurt or killed by a firearm?   and if so I apologize.'
That's the trick, isn't it? If its a threat. But since when is a fetus a threat? Sure, when the fetus is endangering the mother's life, fine. But 97% of the time, it's not.   Can a woman kill using her own body? Steal? Rape? No, of course not. I can't rape anyone and get away with it because I used my own body. Next time you get caught stealing, tell the judge that you were using your own body to do it, and you can do whatever you want with your own body. Enjoy the following laugh.   And prove to me that a fetus is not a living human. In fact, find ANYTHING that is made of cells and is or was not living.
Really? Funny, my son, even before I "came out" didn't think gays were bad or being gay was bad. He saw hate as being the real evil...and you exemplify that just perfectly...brava!
Again Monty has shown that he doesn't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks. It is not true that science has "found" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.   And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.   Hank says:
And amusingly enough, you who claim you don't have any interest in changing the outcome spend soooo much time posting on these threads...   Perhaps that's another claim that's just false in your opinion?
And you can "lol" all you want. So tell me what it is about a brain that has not developed that requires more protection than a brain that is temporarily out of commission? And yes, we could very well debate potentials, but that is a different branch of the bigger picture and personally I don't see a reason to go down it, at least not at this point.
According to Montalban, he doesn&#8217;t use sarcasm and quite often bitterly complains when I use it. Opps, maybe he made a mistake and is trying to cover it up. LOL
Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they, termites could assure that if properly used. After 40 days and more they would be ravenous.
And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?
60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.
And a good one at that. I can hear the wheels a-spinnin&#8217;
So how can evilutionists have any confidence in carbon dating if they keep updating the calibration curve? Huh?
Let me see if I have this right, Priscilla. You admit your ignorance of the topic and you refuse to read the linked article in order to learn the topic of the thread, and yet you are willing to offer an opinion.   As Mr. Jack said, interesting.
well that could happen if somhow you mutated into some..i dunno...600 armed person. ?
And how do you know what other animals can analyze? Is that another supreme abilities of us humans? To read the minds of animals?
So you deny that this man is a victim? Realize that the gunshot drew attention, and attention is something criminals don't want. Maybe without that gunshot, the guy would've been beaten to death. But I suppose you'd be happier, because at least the old man wasn't a gun owner. Or I suppose you think he should've let the criminal have the money; all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.
but you too are a figment of my imagination, and you only think you are a giant alien dreaming about this world because i imagined you as such. you cannot disprove this either.
But why? What is so important about an embryo that it can be given a "person" status?
Good. The less moronic "spirituality" in each state the better. Let's move out of the dark ages as fast as we can.
No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off.
Actually quite a common name in South America... but I know what you mean.
''No, actually the earth is 150 years old. FACT. And its age never changes. FACT.''   -Chris Formage, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
Actually what sank that debate was a bunch of paleontologists from K state who started arguing for punctuated equilibrium. That was pretty much the end. I remember one board member was quoted as saying "These are public schools. We are luck if we can teach the kids to read"
Since animals can operate them, gun owners obviously need sufficient training to make sure they are used safely. It seems they need a lot more. On the other hand, the problem is largely self-limiting, since the cretinous owner either dies or hopefully learns from their stupidity once they recover from their injuries.

Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.
Hey thanks for the "edited/out of context sermon." Peter was rebuked for interfering with the plans of God. Oh . . . Christ never said to throw the sword away. . . "put it away" means put it away in the sheath.   Mark 8: 31 And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things and to be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again. 32 And He spoke the word openly. And taking Him aside, Peter began to rebuke Him. 33 But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan, because you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men. 34 And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take his cross, and let him follow Me. 35 For whoever desires to save his life, he shall lose it. But whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel, that one shall save it. 36 For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, yet damage his soul? 37 Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul? 38 For whoever may be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father, along with the holy angels.   Matt 26: 47 And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him was a numerous crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48 And the one betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss, it is He; seize Him. 49 And coming up at once to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi. And he ardently kissed Him. 50 But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then coming up, they laid hands on Jesus and seized Him. 51 And, behold, one of those with Jesus, stretching out the hand, drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword shall perish by a sword. 53 Or do you think that I am not able now to call on My Father, and He will place beside Me more than twelve legions of angels? 54 How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?
78.4 years? Well excuse me but I intend to live much longer than that. I was thinking about 112.7 years. Yeah. That's about right.
Oh? Since you are so inquisitive about my medical procedures, would you like the readout of my last yearly physical? My cholesterol levels? Whether or not my blood sugar content was high?
But maybe god does not hate gays, maybe he just hates the ones that demand to have sex with people whether they want it or not.
You made the claim. Another lie from the radical cheap seats!
Yeah, yeah we can all do math. Why do you even bother? You said statistics is just a game. -VOR   Take it seriously.
You're getting rusty NATO.   It was a college campus. Guns ARE banned where this happened.   Maybe simone can explain yet another instance of a shooting in a "gun free zone"?   How many of these shootings on "gun free" college campuses need to happen before we ever get a comment on how these bans are working so well?   I mean, after an average of once a week, you would think suggesting banning guns would be a laughable suggestion. Yet, after every shooting where guns are completely banned, there seems to be a suggestion that we need stricter gun control. How do you get tighter than 100% forbidden?   Anyone care to state the definition of insanity for posterity?
If you had bothered to spend more than two seconds actually looking up what happened, you would've seen that Joe Horn was cleared of all wrong doings by a grand jury, not on the grounds of the new Castle Doctrine of Texas, but the already existing laws that permits the use of deadly force for preventing property crimes. These laws were on the books for years before Texas officially adopted the NRA endorsed Castle Doctrine.   And even so, what're you complaining about? Would you rather Joe Horn be the one killed and the criminals alive today?
I think jyoshu has posted a BS meter which is pretty nice.
Quote from your appeal to authority:   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And it isn't the job of the school to teach anyone about your god. That is the job of the parents. If it is a good idea to teach about your god in the public school, it is also a good idea to teach about mine. How about Wicca and Islam. A good idea, right?   But if some creationists don't like their children learning science, then they should put them in their own "christian" schools where they can become scientific illiterates who think that heliocentrism is a fact.
Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity ).
you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise.
So Simone, if the shooter had instead driven his Toyota Prius into a crowd, killing many as a result, would you call for banning Toyota Priuses?
Actually, they have. But only Leviticus and Numbers.
Atheists tend to ignore information they don't like also.
Sometimes?   The state of the public education system in the US is downright criminally neglectful.
If you are open minded enough to consider an opposing point of view, Maybe one day you and I can debate those claims. But if you are a typical drive by post and run away "choicer?" I wouldn't be interested.   I digress!   The purpose of this thread (as I understand it) was for people to introduce themselves and say a little about their position. The purpose of this thread was not to debate our differences. I'll not respond to any more "baiting" of that sort in this thread. If you have questions about the details of my views, I will gladly answer those. As I may have some questions about yours.
Yes, the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical. I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem. I have lots and lots of guns, right here at my house. Last year, the murder rate at my house was 0. I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year.   What school are you at?
Way to make a controversial, unsupported assertion, Winston!
I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.
Maybe what they're saying is "Grow some balls and practice civil disobedience by violating anti-Constitutional Laws that threaten your safety.
How extraordinary that Catholic theologians understand the Old Testament better than the folks who wrote it because they "have more books to understand that passage."   Yeah, there has been a lot of Catholic blather written to obfuscate the Bible.
So you think that, if murders were legal, there would still be the same number?   How about robberies, or rapes? There are plenty of those, the law can't be having any effect...   In short, I'm saying that making anything illegal reduces that thing. Criminalising murder results in less murder, criminalising drugs leads to reduced supply of drugs (compare any drug with nicotine, or alcohol), and criminalising guns would lead to a similar reduction.
And creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false.
All forms of life? Animal life? Plant life? The mold growing in your bathroom?
If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she can abstain from sex.   It works!
Chastity rather than promiscuity.
Oh, I dunno guys... I think I've been saved.   *sings* "I've been redeemed, by the blood of the lamb..." ummm... barbequed lamb.... rare... yumm....   I'm wondering, Benjamin, if you would trade some photos of the Holy Pink Bunny for the shroud of Turin?
Abstinence until you are old enough to handle sexual relationships responsibly should most certainly be preached along with information about and access to birth control.   There are plenty of us who have no interest in the institution of marriage - your religion should not determine who amongst is a sexually active adult. Not to mention we have got to stop pushing the gotta get married have a partner to be a happy seccuesful person message - ESPECIALLY TO GIRLS - it will lead to sex, for heaven forbid they be SINGLE.
not bad for a procedure that doesn't exist.
Well, let's see.   1 This is a skull from a modern human, the differences representing pathological deformities.   2 The dating is based on disputed methodology. Creation scientists have proved that radioisotope dating is unreliable.   3 The two pieces are only assumed to be from the same individual.   4 Where's the conclusive DNA evidence? (A nod to easyrider on the Religion board.)   5 These claims are made by scientists, and all science is an atheistic conspiracy against religion (thank you marc9000).   6 So where's the missing link between the new fossil and us? Huh? Huh?   Sadly, past experience suggests that creationists can wriggle on indefinitely.
Wow, you PROVED the Big Bang to be a big dud? I didn't see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals. I must have overlooked it. Can you give the reference to your article?
What in the name of heaven is "passive particulate selection" is that found in quantitative genetics in some obscure corner - I challenge you to produce a reference to the term in the open literature. And Mendel's theory was itself (if anything is) particulate in nature and it was NOT derived from Darwin at all. It preceded Darwin and later of course DID serve as a plug in addition to supplant Darwins own inadequate theory of inheritance. And of course Mendel is long ago supplanted by much more detailed and modern genetic knowledge.   As to "dynamic sytemic adaptation" I also suggest you need to document where that term originates from other than yourself. Just what does that mean which is NOT covered by the vary-select-inherit process? Please tell us oh mighty lagomorph how antibiotic resistance arises by "dynamic systemic adaptation" instead of plain old VSI processes and how you distinguish the two.   [QUOTEHave to go now.[/quote]   Good because my tolerance for people who pontificate in pseudoscientific terms while pretending to themselves that they know what they are talking about is wearing very very thin.
Apes are sentient...guess your theory is out the window. Either that or Apes need to be freed from the zoo.
And yet the species that exist today are the exact same as the species during the high oxygen content? That makes little sense. It's like saying the world was vastly different before yet perfectly suited for the species that exist today. That is COMPLETELY nonsensical.   Where did all of the oxygen go?
You are one crazy poster Steeeve. 62 posts in 2 days. You live on here or what? Well, anyway, I like your style so far, so keep up the good work.
I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.
However, that would make supersport a comic genious.   Tough call.   Waxy
Said like a lazy, ignorant person who would rather live off the sweat of others than go out and earn for himself.
What, you mean like this story (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003? Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example.
And thus the human condition is explained at last!
So you think Zeus and all the other Greek gods exist?
hmm. really, I think it is. and so does the pope.
attack on the definition of marriage?   Why is it an "attack" to include gay couples in as married?   Would it be an "attack" on something for blacks to not have to be segregated from whites?
I know! How dare they just not sit back and accept the discrimination they so rightly deserve. It's just incredible the amount physical and emotional damage you would undergo if these people are given the same kind of respect you are. We can't have that! This may be a a government for the people, and I am sorry but you are only part of the people and to be granted the respect of people if you screw and love the people that the majority say you have to screw and love. God bless er Buddha bless er Mohammed bless...er Rhiannon bless America!
Maybe they just drink too much coffee.   And you probably work with more "reefer heads" than you think.
And in those 150 years, all the evolutionists in the world haven't been able to falsify or debunk the book of Genesis. Of course, in their own deluded minds, they actually believe they have done just that.
So you dont know?
Bob!!!! You're bad!!!!
So penfold and brady you are in favour of denying citizens rights even though they have not been proved to have commited any crime? Ed Kennerdy was on that list so should he be discriminated against even though he has commited NO crime? What is next putting black people on the list purely because of the colour of their skin?   You sicken me you two. Why on gods earth would terrorists be buying civilian guns when they could just use AK47? Did you sniff petrol as a youngster as you seem to have.
Innocent life? We have had some interesting debates here where Christians have yielded to evidence that the state executes innocents yet they still support the death penality.   As I recall, the woman who committed adultry was guilty and subject to death under the law (of Moses) yet Christ said one without sin should throw the stone. Are Christians that support the death penality without sin?   In-house debate? Whose house?   Dono
LOL. “Bats haven't evolved in millions of years”
What is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?
The reality is that it's the ANTI-GAY side who too often include pretenses of "society imploding"...   Can you name me anybody who has asserted "society imploding" or "weight of legal quagmire" on the "gay pride movement" side?   Once again, you run away with pointless strawman arguments...
You know why. Because they want you to stop posting. Most of them want to rant, and they don't want their rants challanged. It's typical of the whole evolutionary community, I'm afraid. Obvious_child and I are exploring this up in the "numbers" thread.
The Muslim invasion.   You guys need targets right?
Did you get another cracker polly?
So I can take this as a quote to use for you in the future to show you that (at one time) you didn't disagree with that argument?   Good to know!   It's bookmarked!
Doesn't matter if they "give it up" or not. They don't legally issue death certificates for abortions. Imagine that. Death certificates are ONLY issued to once living persons. OH WAIT!!! I think we just proved that a ZEF is not a "person"
So what are you trying to do here - smother everyone with bafflegab ?
Yes, it seems you never learn, so I have no hope of educating you, and absolutely no intention.   Since you ask nicely, the answer is "Supreme soveriegn authority", i.e. the fact that governments are established among men to secure their basic rights-- i.e. they not left to individual whims to respect or violate as each pleases, in the model of classic anarchy.   States are thus delegated by their People, with the power to to protect these rights through laws.   I believe we've gone over this before; you didn't understand it then, I doubt you will now... or ever. It's still true, however: ignorance is never disproof.   If you form your own nation, you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the laws however you choose; however that's neither here nor there.
Some interesting information, that website where you got your link from, "Reasons To Believe" (RTB) is not a creationist organisation. It is run by compromising Christians, such as Dr Hugh Ross. Answers in Genesis have got quite a lot of information on him and as a result have even more rebuttals to his arguments. Here are several links:   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4149.asp   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4128.asp   I did notice, however, that the RIB article was written in the year 1999. This is most pecular, because the AiG article in which Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself is written in the year 2000. The following link is a very brief summary of how Dr Humphreys defended himself and his new Relativistic Cosmology from compromising Christians and evolutionists:   http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs...10-10-2000.asp   The following link is where Dr Russell Humphreys defends himself. It shows both the arguments and his rebuttals:   http://www.trueorigin.org/ca_rh_03.asp   I would strongly suggest that you read it.   I can definitely see how you may doubt Dr Humphreys new Cosmology, that was a pretty heavy attack, the much of it went zip, right over my head. But I just can't help but feel that they mis-interpreted several lines and are using some straw man attacks. I personally cannot see anything wrong with his arguments, although if there is, he has given way for a new area of cosmology, a Creationist Cosmology.   I hope that this helps clear up this little problem regarding "Starlight and Time". Got to go,   Matt.
You are on some different planet there. Science doesn't need one conclusion or the other. The traditional classification of neandertals has been Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, i.e., in the same species. Then genetic work suggested that neandertals were distinct enough to merit being a separate species [Hodges, S. B., 2000, Human Evolution: A start for population genomics. Nature (7 Dec. 2000): 408(6813):652-653.]. Results since then have been mixed. Some DNA work indicates a 5% admixture from Neandertals (Plagnol V, Wall JD, 2006, Possible ancestral structure in human populations. PLoS Genetics @ http://genetics.plosjournals.org/per...20105.eor&amp;ct=1 ). Various fossils continue to suggest some interbreeding. (Note also that a genetic finding of no interbreeding does not conflict with fossilized hybrids - it merely says that any hybrids or hybrid lines ended up dying out before they contributed to any lineages that were successful all the way to the present.)   A finding of 99.5 to 99.9% genetic similarity is what we expect, given the clear similarity of the two groups.
Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of "proofs" reveal themselves. What's next, Nostradamus?
Now you are being insulting. Evolution makes no statments about your god. For that matter, neither does cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics or geology.
Math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it.
joke ( P ) Pronunciation Key (jk)   n.   Something said or done to evoke laughter or amusement, especially an amusing story with a punch line.   A mischievous trick; a prank.

An object of amusement or laughter; a laughingstock: His loud tie was the joke of the office.   Calm down, kid.
As far as I'm aware your aim is for abortion not to happen, my point is that despite making it illegal it will still happen -- making it illegal is not achieving your aim.   Hence my point is sound, and as such it is a good point.
...? Either you've misread what I said, twisted what I said, or you're just stupid.
Yep thats true.   There in separate buildings but right next to each other.   I see it being about as attractive as a crack house next to a school with a revolving door in front.
I believe my wording was "very rare". Please do not exaggerate my statements by mis-quoting me.   But as you have mentioned it, care to produce some figures on the frequency of partial birth abortions? Its just you have a habit of making over-inflated statements to support your arguements.
So which came first? The liquor or the egg?
You know, from the title, I was sure this would be about The hitchhikers guede to the galaxy' bible fish...
Well, that's because all those things happened during the Age of Law (the god of swift and harsh justice bit), whereas now we're in the Age of Grace (the god is all-forgiving bit), so . . . . er . . . hang on a minute.
Homosexuals are attracted to adults of the same sex.   Pedophiles are attracted exclusively to children.   There are people, such as the case with these priests, who molest children, who are not pedophiles.   Molestation, like rape, isn't about sexual attraction. It is VIOLENCE. People don't molest or rape because they are so turned on they can't help themselves, they do it to HURT somebody.   Get some information before shooting off at the mouth VOR. Most of those priests were probably niether gay nor pedophiles. I HATE IT - when people spread this ****. It is FALSE information that does nothing but HARM. It puts blame on the innocent while the guilty get ignored and children get hurt.   Do not use this lie to justify your bigotry - for you do so at the cost of innocent people - adults and children.
we should turn this entire forum into a mythical/religion vs mythical/religion origin debate.   let's see how well the creationists here do against Hindu, Norse, Egyptian, Zoroastrian, Manichean, Yezidi and the whole host of other religion's beliefs of origin.
How is mythology relevant?
Actually not.
Oh, WW, come on now. If you say something to me about how Vitality works, and I say 'that's a stupid / simple-minded idea', are you seriously telling me you wouldn't take that as a personal attack?
How can they? If they exist in the mind and not on there own, then I can chose not do think about or believe in these laws (Bivalency, Involution, Idempotency,Identity, (Non-)Contradiction, Excluded Middle, Contraction, Commutatively, DeMorgan's, Associatively, Distributivity) and they stop existing? Or I could say, "hofflenosh" is a concept I think is stupid and does not exist, come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either. If is existed only in the mined, it would not be absolute. It would be your opinion of the law of logic existing against someone that says they do not exist.
Yes, have you?
Say hello to my little friend! We the people, through our State Governments!
For bringing health care to women without the means ? For providing Pap Smears, Mammograms, and birth control for women without the means ? Providiing pre-natal, and post-natal care ? Oh, heck, let the women die of breast cancer and uterine cancer ! Why not; bash Gays, then you bash the women.
You are SO insulting.   "Oh, the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly."   Who are you to say they aren't thinking clearly? I'll give it to you, Bassman. You are the most polite, best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered. You nearly had me fooled.
But will you listen?
I think the correct term is Priuseses
Hit that one right on the head, Symbiote. I'd like to hear supersport's response to this.
And Hogwarts seems like a great school according to the first Harry Potter.
Well let me say that so far that you haven't been doing a very good job. My arguments are completely solid, and you haven't even gotten close to refuting them. You accuse me of being stupid because my mom watched star trek, you refute my arguments by providing the defonition of masturbation and periods, and then you call me illogical and tell me to think about my statements more deeply.   [quote]You said that you can only abort in the first and second trimester, which I already know. But saying that you don't exsist in these stages is a huge misstatement.[quote]   Let me rephrase that. The beginnings of my body existed. What you know as "me" the person who's saying this, did not exist. My brain, which is really "me" did not exist.
Just when you think WW's debating skills can't get any worse...
So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women?
Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.
And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies.
So you'd ask on these issues even if you didn't know if they had signed it?
Well I guess you apparently trust the political bunch and rich and famous.
Do you want them all dead?
You know what?   You're officially too clueless to post on this thread.   You obviously haven't bothered yourself to figure out what's going on, so I'm going to kindly ask that you leave until you figure out what is going on.   As I escort you out the door (metaphorically), let me just repeat something for you that was in the FIRST SENTENCE of the article that you obviously couldn't be bothered to read...   I'll even make it nice and big so maybe it will help with your reading comprehension!   collect detailed data about each abortion performed --   and post it all on a public Web site.   Feel free to rejoin us when you figure out what's going on.
end where? ambiguously phrased.   if "here"="death", then yes! by definition, yes!
Oh! I get it! abortion is fun, it is only a traumatic experience (to kill your unborn son/daughter) for "unbalanced" women
Which demonstrates your failure to see the big picture.
why are you afraid of guns? has one jumped up and shot at you? you should never fear a gun, respect the gun.
While it may be true that an ovum is formed during the mother's fetal stage, an ovum is not a unique human entity in and of itself. It does not become a unique human entity until it is fertilized at conception.   (Do you like semantics games?)
Translation; "Do what I say or I will kick your @ss." Sounds a lot like the mafia. And you love this diety?
BECAUSE I SAID SO!   LOL,... I'm so silly.   I just had to post it.   Seriously, I decided that I will actually construct my summary online, Iangb.   If you (or anyone else) cares to, you will be able to watch as I edit and construct my argument. It may be lengthy so keep it in mind that if I have to divide it up, and you post in the interim, I will have to delete this first half and move it to the end.   By the way,... other than working some things out in my head,... I don't have anything prepared to post. This will be a work in progress.   ... this will take quite a while. (Maybe days)   I see you are watching, and don't want you thinking this will be developing quickly.   I will let you know when I've concluded.   --Chuz   *** Note to Ian. In my attempt to compile my 'summary' I have realized that I never actually completed my arguments. It's kind of hard to summarize that which hasn't already been presented.

Thank you for your criticism. :D
And of course, the sea of Montalban's assertions as science, the sea of Montalban's out of context quotes, or the sea of Montalban's misrepresentations of what others have said. It seems that Montalban knows the "TROOTH" and won't be discouraged with facts. Sadly, Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant.
What difference does it make? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents? If so doesn't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas?
Actually, they didn't. The whole tragedy was caused by gun control. If even one student was packing when that occured, 33 lives could have been saved. But no, more victims of botched laws and corrupt politicians.
You didn't bother to read the link, I see, which said:   "During the 70-year Babylonian captivity, from 606-537 B.C., the southern kingdom of Israel, Judah, had lost it's national sovereignty, but retained it's tribal staff or national identity.2 It is very significant that in the book of Ezra we read that during the 70-year Babylonian captivity the Jews still retained their own lawgivers or judges.3 The Jews maintained their identity and judicial authority over their own people even during 70 years of slavery. The scepter had not been lost during the Babylonian captivity."
What are you afraid of, Trebor?? The whole world wants to know why you keep avoiding this question:   According to your own Jewish Tanakh, is God the Creator of the heavens and earth, and man?   Will he give a pertinent answer or evade it again?? I'm betting he won't answer the question.
And...?
Given your very poor English (spelling, punctuation and basic sentence structure), I think the assumption that anyone can understand 'exactly what you are saying' is a very poor one.   Smiley   PS I have highlighted some of the errors in latest attempt.
FDR saved this country? If I recall, it was in 1933 that, because of a combination of weakened capital situations from Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans which published lists of the loan takers, and a nation-wide banking holiday, banks around the country went through a new wave of demise, dropping the D/C and D/R ratios so sharply that, in one month alone, the money stock (M2) fell a whopping 4 1/2%.   Wasnt it under FDR that the NIRA codes, and, after 1935, the NLRA, enacted minimum wages, driving up nominal wages and thus unemployment?   Wasnt it during FDR administration that the reserve ratio was *doubled*, sending us back into another recession starting 1937?   The only thing FDR "saved" was the depression for a couple more years.   -GFA
And you don't have any picture. You have no idea of what recessive really means, do you. Actually, since the first observation of a black peppered moth in 1848, several other mutations have caused other variations of color in peppered moths. They are intermediate between the typica and the carbonaria, but they are extremely rare. These alleles form a hierarchy of dominence in which the carbonaria is the full dominant, and the typica is fully recessive.   Please define "kind." Please define "variation." Please explain the origin of this "variation in kind."
Gun Control is not on this list of crime contributing factors. However banning guns would leave the law-abiding defenseless in the face of these criminal predators. Why don't you work for changing these conditions instead of working for something that has no effect on reducing crime (gun control).   However, if you think you can prove gun control will work as crime control, then go for it! Maybe you can cower us with your overwhelming evidence.
If this is your stance, then it's your job to prove it correct. Show us that Britain is just fine, show us that the criminals aren't awarded more protection than their victims.   Show us thimble head. Show us or shut up.
So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.
When's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime? And don't you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone?
What does spelling have to do with your own opinion? Again this isn't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone's spelling and just didn't answer the question. This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion. It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate.
hey, watch yourself.........watch it..
You should refrain from calling others arrogant Mr. Kettle.
So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized "Good morning, sweetie", that would be an answer?
Yep, suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go. We should also get them to stop pooping.
Blah, blah. So you looked something up. Adds nothing.
After reading that I had to go talk to Ralph on the big white telephone.
Ladling out the guilt again, Maximus?   Don't forget take a large helping for yourself.
I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state.
I note that you consider yourself irrational, though I could not possibly comment. There are times that I am grateful that your parents chose to live on the wrong side of the Atlantic, but then I allow for your need to identify with your adopted home and reject the motherland.   You flatter yourself in assuming that you were any part of my considerations when choosing to post. The button reference is a play on words known as a pun.
Well Im not hunting animals
Actually, no, they do NOT. The first three ALL describe God causing them - are you saying the bible is describing God's actions negatively? Or are you saying that killing your precious foetuses is just fine as long as the persons carrying them are "wicked". Sorry, but you need to get an argument, Phyllis.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Spelling and grammar for this post has been checked and cleared   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Yes, and since some might not, it should not be mentioned at all?   Personally I only know a half dozen people who have had abortions (at least that I know if). 1 of them doesn't care, she has had 6 or 8 abortions...pretty much used them instead of the pill. 2 are pro life zealots now and feel terrible about the fact they had aboortions. 2 are pro life, but not zealots. The final one was overwhelming pro choice prior to her abortion. Attended rallies and everything. SHE felt so bad about havinghte abortion afterwards that 6 months later she blew her head off. She could not get it out of her head that she had killed a baby. She became totally obsessed and finally cracked.   So, yea...maybe it is not so out of line for people, including men, to say "Think about it real hard because a lot of people regret it". You don't have to get shot to know it hurts.
It is impossible to read something that can't be found.
I think he's referring to intelligent, educated people with a good sense of humour (good looking too ) who aren't paranoid beyond reason, can spell correctly and know what real beer is.   Smiley
I think you and my ten year old could really connect.   Happy Easter, Jim. You really are one of my favorite conservatives.
And don't forget the part that we're all hot for her, too.
Translation: "Shut up, I'm right!"
How the hell can you narrow it down to three? The competition in the entire top ten is fierce.
Oh what a corageous maverick you are.
Because it works. How much money is pumped into microchip design and production? IBM engineers must be so corrupt; the temptation to lie about quantum theory so they can pretend to offer faster processors must be overwhelming! And don't get me started on the evolutionary algorithms they use - clear evidence of atheist bias and lying. As if evolution could design better microchips!   Research based on evolutionary theory is well funded because there's massive potential for return on investment. Who funds ICR? If you're so keen to follow the money, at least do it consistently.
Yes, socialist. Check the definition. I don't watch Fox. Is that the best you can do?
I believe that this is what they call 'sarcasm'.   As for the second part of your comment, why am I not surprised?
So doing a detailed study of something requires that one takes a class for it in a university and reads books papers written on it by "real scientists"? Wow, I never knew that. Thanx for enlightening me.
You could learn a lot from this quote.
So taking away all their guns would have been better? The ruling party was certainly well armed how about the other parties?
My first line of defense for up to 300 yards is an M4 (specops m16) flattop with an ACOG scope and tritium backup sights, 14.5 barrel with a 1/7 twist with mccluek (sp) muzzle brake to make it the legal 16 inches. foward pistol grip and a surefire light mounted to my knights RASII. I keep 45 grains in the clips so they frange and not penatrate walls. I keep a second clip with 77gr noslers in a mag-cinched clip for longer range shots. I use a long range Shephered scope on my .308 chambered m14 for shotting zombies out to 1000 yards. And to compliment my defensive ability I keep a romanian AK in my bugout bag with a surefire light and an OKO red dot scope for quick egress when reliability is of most importance and close range firefight is likley. (this in not to mention the plethora of pistoles and handguns I keep for home defense also). THe m4 is 1.5 MOA, The M14 (m1a) is sub MOA, and the AK is a typical 3-4moa. BTW. I have had military and civilian training in all of these weapons   I also keep a well trained Caucasian Mountain dog roaming the house at night so if anyone where to make it inside I doubt there would be anything left of him by the time I got there...   Preparedness my friends...   Now VoR probably keeps his Rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wifes neck and a fancy pug roaming the house...   Dear Mr. Criminal,   Which house would you like to break into.   SIncerely,   1 constitutional rights violator and 1 law abiding citizen.
So all jellyfish die on the beach?   Hardly.   Let's use this same type of logic though.   A jellyfish is pretty fragile, as you pointed out.   Wouldn't a jellyfish that was very rapidly covered in sediment be broken into many pieces, if not ground to a paste?   Wouldn't this entirely rule out the possibilty of preservation in this manner?
Way to miss the entire point, Clerisian.   My point was that is it a horrible experience for many women, and that I wish we could strive towards a society where abortions were no longer needed. Wishful thinking by a midtwenties female who just went through the most horrifying experience of her life, forgive me if I didn't clarify well enough.   I can't imagine that anyone would disagree with that.
OH FREE MARKET???? IM goin to take the embryos and fetuses slain in abortion centers and turn it into a new food source and sell it at the grocery store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.
Utter XXXX. Doctors will regularly provide advice on lifestyle changes to those at risk of a variety of diseases and conditions, contact information as to where they can find support in making those lifestyle changes, and if appropriate refer them to psychologists to assist them in making those changes. Dentists will give long lectures on the evils of eating sugar and suggest appropriate snack replacements for sugary foods.   What else does "walking the walk" entail? Should the "medical establishment" follow their patients around and forcibly prevent them from having a lifestyle they believe to be harmful?   Then why aren't doctors who advise rest and plenty of fluids for a cold in jail? Oh right, because you're lying, as usual.   Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition, however inadequately, this doesn't mean they're going to recommend crackpot "raw food" dietary schemes to prevent destructive "lamarckian evolution" on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats.
Oh dear. Have you ever looked at a human spine? It is curved: it's bent. A straight spine is a knackered spine. As to the hands bit, what are you on about? You are aware I hope that the story that the nosey elephant got it's trunk because a crocodile grabbed the end and stretched it is just a story?
What quaint illogic. Only people who marry can get divorced, so a reduction in people marrying has no effect on rising divorce rates. If anything, a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages points to an even higher divorce rate than "normal".
by this stupidity a KKK mob with guns is a militia!
On the contrary, the wet dreams of those slavering over these appalling British figures miss the fact that bad as they are, those 3 or 4 more murders in the USA per hundred thousand population equates to your likelihood of being murdered there as at least ten times higher than in that dangerous place Britain. Suck on that.
So that's a problem of “fundamentalism”, and not a problem with the one creating the “parody”? Apparently the creation of parodies for “fundamentalism” is a large part of atheism.
So? Life is cheap. You can't change that, the least you can do is profit from it. And people call me a leftist! That's a hardcore capitalist view.
Just to add more fuel on the fire :P
Can you read? You linked to a site that is essentially a bibliography. The title is "Feminism AND Science." Did you intend to mislead?
He was probably an XXXXX to begin with then.
God talk about a bunch of foo foo poop!   What are you a girl?   Any way honey, dont you think that net result was a lot of people who for one reason or another could not resist there biological programming will get AIDS because they were told not to have sex in place of getting condoms?   I cant believe I had to explain that to you.
No. Perhaps some effort into educating yourself would be appropriate. I presume that you expected a yes answer and your next question would have been, "why are there still monkeys/apes?"   I sincerely request that you look at all of the skulls in the following two pictures. Please give me your opinion as to what each of these may be and how they came about. Please be aware that "GAWD DID IT" is laughable. I am aware that you are usually free from thought, but please make an exception and think about your answers.   http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/skulls.html   http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/skulls2.html
Cars don't breed. Or didn't you know that?
Since when? So if I were to post a news article where someone says that pedophilia should be legalized, then it means I agree with them? I thought this was a discussion board. That means we, you know, DISCUSS THINGS.   Now, if I had said "Here is AiG's article and I couldn't agree with them more", then you would have an argument.   As I did not, you don't. Now, do you retract your false statement that what you quoted was my reasoning?
Kudos to your counterpart for nicely wrapping up all the creationist talking points into one nice essay. He did an excellent job of paraphrasing answersingenesis, he even hit all the highlights, right down to the human footprints with dinosaurs.   I dont' even know where to begin. The part on geology and the earth's magnetic field was so idiotic it's hard to fathom that someone actually wrote that as a serious point.   I'm continually astounded by the lengths creationists will go to to try and justify their beliefs.   The only thing more astounding is their conviction in the belief of their own rhetoric.   Waxy
depends on your definition of "human being."
No surprise there. You would have to invest some thought to define something. Why don't you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary?
Proving, yet again, some Democrats are, after all, honorable men and women.
Really? From what university did you earn your science degree that makes you qualified to make judgements about what is science?
So your answer to the question then is "Nothing", Marc?
But apparently they can't say no to renting the property for a gay wedding, even if they decide to just say 'no' to everyone and get out of business. go figure
There is no god that supports the forcing of women to suffer and carry out unplanned pregnancies, just because some PL advocate spits it our. "Sorry, were going to force you to give birth, those men over there have decided".   Thats as ridiculous as saying "There is no god to condones the slaughter of thousands of innocent life forms inside of the cut" (referring to disinfecting a cut).   Pro-lifers have been dropped on their head too many times.
so why is population control a good arguement for abortion? Why don't we kill old people too...
And many of the questions that creationists ask.
Because all scientists hate god, this is a fact.
Yeah.   They should just be more consistent and have no hypocrisy in a stance that just discriminates against gays...   <end sarcasm>
So what else is new? Does Texas support the death penalty?
haha...I'll remember this next time I think of accusing you of spitting in one direction
Yeah they were. Mostly killed by criminals with guns. Now prove that any legislation that Obama could have enacted would have prevented those deaths.   I'm not holding my breath and I'm not expecting a rational response either...
Really, did it take long? ROFL. Did they turn grass into a tree or maybe rice into a tomato? Got pics?
Oh really the people who where behind the petition drive here in michigan want to deny me marriage, Here I will let the head of the organization that spearheaded the drive explain it in her own words.   http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=19408
And when the President speaks in public we could hand out guns to the audience so that they could respond to any assassination attempt.
Cute. And I can come up with about 5,000 to 7,000 examples that do have a bright orange muzzle.
Oh yeah right, like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them, can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling.
So in other words your God put you on Earth to stop people from killing so your God could kill them eventually?
There ya go, Tither, three guys out of several hundred thousand?
I believe they got XXXXXX at all the conservates on this board. So they went and joined a commie discussion board where they feel more welcome and can send congrats to each other for being smarter than regular people.
And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.
And secondly, it's a bit rich for them to call it murder when a blastocyst can turn into a tumour.   And oncologists murder tumours all the time...
Well, I haven't mutated into some other species last time I checked.
And a lot of blacks were killed through hangings. Are you against rope vendors?
So? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman's uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds.
Once cannot abort a pregnancy if it has not begun.   The morning after pill prevents a pregnancy from ever occuring by preventing the fertilized egg from implanting.   If one considers pregnancy to begin at conception (i.e. fertilization of the egg), then petri dishes are pregnant when eggs are fertilized on them ("conception") for later IVF.   Do we really want to be considering petri dishes pregnant?
Oh joy another drive by with absolutely no proof or evidence.
Including the universe?
In my lifetime, we've made huge strides, but there's a lot more to learn.
Oh look, a lie. Imagine my surprise.   Truth: Scientists have extrapolated that the universe expanded from an incredibly dense mass. The Big Bang theory does not posit that this mass "popped" into existence; in fact, we have no idea what happened less than 10^-43 seconds after expansion began. It is a common interpretation that there was no time "before" the mass existed, therefore the first law of thermodynamics was not violated.
So, how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis? Talk about hypocrisy.
So, you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory? And is actually supported by evidence? If they have any evidence, why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility. The fact is, they have no credible evidence at all as the big bang is nothing more than a deduction based on theoretical mathematical equations which can neither be confirmed or verified.   Just read the link and consider the factors cosmologists must consider before even doing the math required to come up with an age. Now consider how skewed the outcome must be if they are incorrectly interpreting even one aspect of the info they are relying on for the equations which result in an age.   Any errors in those results and the out equations are useless. Thus, the 10 billion year gap in their cosmological guessing game.   How Old is the Universe?   Now consider the creator of the big bang theory itself. Edwin Hubble proposed the big bang as a possible beginning of the Universe based on the perceived expansion of the universe from a tiny central singularity back in 1929. Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began. http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm   This theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which doesn't claim that God did it.
There you go. It's difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of when the facts are the facts!
How would you like to have a parasite in your body and not be given treatment to remove it based solely on the fact that even parasitic organisms are living things and deserve life?   Not pretty is it? Imagine being one of those guys in the Alien movies and you've got a chestburster in you that's gonna kill you once its fully gestated, but you're not allowed to have an operation to have it removed from your body because of an intergalatic treaty declaring that all life is precious and must be observed.
and thats just kiddish!
Oh my stars and garters.   He actually admitted what "the real issue" is.
I dunno.   Do you think the Tooth Fairy will be happy with people drink-driving?   Any argument from a religious stand-point necessitates proving that said religion is true. Do that, and you'll get a lot of respect from a lot of people.
In other words, the author seems to think that because Mendel didn't know about genes mutating, we must continue to believe they don't.   Complete and utter nonsense from beginning to end.
Way to support your controversial assertion, Bell.
You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated. People will have abortions legal or not legal. At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger.
The Book of Genesis is either secular or observed history? Somebody get marc a dictionary, please. (And I'd link him to a long list of observed instances of speciation, but he'd ignore it yet again.)
But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?
So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?
As the great Spock said Logic dictates that logic need not apply in this situation.
Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that "...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed." Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts.
So is Jesus, aka God, a liar?   Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo's life to be saved really God's child? Gee, I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor, priest, or what have you, that prayed but God didn't listen because that religious leader is a fraud? Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!
I love this line. I assume by "harm" you mean an actual physical harm or some kind or another (physical in this case includes loss of items). So this would cut our laws in half. Walk around naked? No big deal! Have sex on the street why doing cocaine...go for it! Drunk in public? Who cares!   The list can go on forever.
You need to experiment with the notion that you will be sexually attracted to your own sex. After you're done, come back and report your findings!
But you are the accuser. I've read the Bible and I have studied religion, more than you can imagine. I have also studied biology, performed experiments and reached conclusions. The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself.
So what? They aren't worth anything, are they? Does it matter if we kill them? No, in your reasoning it doesn't because there are no absolutes.
It's usually easier to take the immoral path. Stealing's easier than working. Lying's easier than telling the truth. Being a deadbeat parent is easier than being a good parent. The list goes on and on.
I still haven't heard an answer to this yet?
This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)
Well, you ignored the part where I said "voting". But IMO legislative solutions ARE part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. ANY legislator claims to "do what's right." So elections tend to be popularity contests. And legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy.   Oh and just to make sure you understand this Kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else I've said. It is not a lie.
Well...   You can apparently read, but what you have apparently chosen to read - and accept - says much.
Interesting how the study was set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They're a city known for violence and gang-related issues. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if those that were shot and counted in this "study" were known gang members who were either shot by their intended victims, or by other rival gang members.
So they're failing because they're XXXXXX?
Who said anything about "redefining" it? I said you would still HAVE YOUR "traditional marriage" according to YOUR chosen religion.
I think that Comrade Brian is pulling our collective legs by pretending to be a die-hard, uninformed, living-in-denial communist, when in fact he's a just another guy trying to have a laugh by trolling the boards.   I truly find it hard to believe that anyone could be so completely uninformed about capitalism and socialism.
Spoken like a true man.
Really? I haven't seen you post your support for any law or proposal that would punish criminals in the most severe ways possible. All I've ever seen you post support for is more laws that criminalize things that aren't crimes and do nothing to harm others.
so watching TV sports = bad daddy?   do you let your boyfriend/girlfriend or husband watch TV sports or only feminist approved TV channels?
So, one set of creationists are XXXXXX, but the others are not?
And if one accepts that gay citizens have equal rights under that Constitution, then one has to accept that a ban on gay marriage is intrinsically unconstitutional.
You know, considering how little ray knows about science, do you think we could write a creationist load of **** and take these XXXXXX for all their money?
Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right.
Well, they ARE ultimately the ones that create a vehicle that can travel at break neck speed...perhaps they are partially liable?   Joke.
I see -- in your opinion is it is "illegitimate", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance.
So what? A person has a right to defend themselves, as spelled out in the Constitution.   Or would you rather the 80 year old just get beaten to death for his $262?   Or maybe you'd feel better if he'd suffered the same fate as the home invader over in Maryland. He made the mistake of breaking and entering into a student house and was slaughtered with a sword.   And what point are you trying to make anyway? It's not like the 80 year old went on a killing spree of anything. Nobody got murdered. So what're you moaning about?
And could you be anymore of a drama queen about it, using the raw sweage thing. That is such a stretch of the truth. People straight and gay have been sodomizing for years and their are very few cases of any of e coli every year. Stop drama queening out!
No, I'm your regional manager.
They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world.
You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.
Just so you don't shoot them!
Will the Obama administration come for your guns?
I think maybe you have hit yourself in the head with the Bible a few times too often.
As opposed to being denied the joys that most of us experience in life. Convenient.   http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sophistry
Sometimes the state of the education system in the USA makes me cry.
And, I'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker, right?
Of course we can ignore all the emotional and physical problems women lose when terminating a pregnancy.
So sorry, I was trying to figure out why God lets some women down, and yet favored you. I always assumed it was a mixture of physiology, luck, etc. Sometimes bad things happen, sometimes good things happen. But you claimed God was the one who saw you through and made sure your daughter was born healthy and functional...So, again, in a similar situation (trust in God, doctors say baby will be born damaged, etc), if it turns out the doctors were right, is God to blame for letting me down? Or was it, in fact, just the way things are sometimes?   Or does God just randomly hear some prayers, but not others? No, no...lemme guess. "God has a plan for us all"?
Hehehehehehe. That made me laugh, but you actually make a good point. They should have I AM JUST A THEORY written on them, otherwise kids will regard them as fact and then where will we be?
Like you were raised? Looks like it didn't work and now those hormones must be kicking in? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax...their favorite victims? Males.
Oh, ok, I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better. How about I refer to them as "intelligence deficient". And I was really not referring to bona fide "retarded" individuals (those with true pathology). I agree that there is nothing funny about that. How about I refer to them as people who drive like XXXXXX...Is that better?
so we are making progress. It seems that SS is now admitting that evolution by natural selection really does happen. He admits that his examples are not what he claims they are.   We also see that he objects for religious rather than scientific reasons and is aware of it. Good for you SS.   Sadly, he seems to be falling back on that old creationist saw about "where are the intermediates."
Oh, it was going so well too
So when somebody with bad intentions breaks and crawls in through a window, and shuts off your power so you can't use the telephone, and comes busting through your basement door, shooting them is vigilante justice? To you this situation doesn't qualify as self-defense?   I highly doubt the woman is lying about the entire matter, because if she was the prosecuting attorney and the police wouldn't be so willing to not press charges against her.
There goes said intelligence...
And lets not neglect the fact that he was tetotal and a vegetarian to boot.   Well, looky here we all learnt today that bad people can have have good characteristics............   Sounds like Pastor Russell Johnson's representation of truth is as selective as it is self serving.
So it doesn't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless, whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s: they are both equal? What planet do you live on, for it sure aren't the real world...
You've gotta love when ignorance lends itself to incredible mistakes like the above statement. "Excepting" that there is some magical sky man is precisely what atheists do.   Looks like we have another Einstein who wants to test his opinions with people who actually know what they're talking about.   lpdm, you'd better learn quickly, or I don't think you'll like it here as much as you were hoping.
Because it's simply too obviously true?
None... unless she uses abortion as a form of birth control and has them regularly.
HOLY SH*T, marc. You're doing EXACTLY WHAT THE REVIEW SAYS YOU PEOPLE DO. You're making the claim without giving any explanation. "OMG TEH SCEINCES IS ATHIESTIC BECUZ THEY JUST AER!!"   Thanks for making it extremely clear. Refuting a point by demonstrating it isn't very effective.   Seriously, how disconnected from reality does one have to be in order to do something like this?
Should all drivers have to help pay for harm done by irresponsible drivers?
So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.
And your Orwellian position is showing.
Oh, well. Apparently you want to talk molecular chemistry whereas I was hoping to discuss organismic evolution. Too bad. Good luck with anyone who wants to debate your topic, but it just doesn't interest me.
I'd be curious if Berkowitz studied whether a sword or club produced the same effect as a firearm?   Short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty, I'm afraid boys will be boys.
/hypothetical mode on.   The State murders an innocent man.   /hypothetical mode off.
You mean, intelligent design, which has been proven in court to be not science, and to be a front for certain religious agenda's, and straight forward arguments based on ignorance of the evidence and logical fallacies.   If you look at the organizations that push I.D. , you will see they have a religious agenda . The discovery institute is funded by religious organizations, and every one of the board will admit they thing the 'intelligent designer' is the Christian god. Read the 'wedge strategy' from them.
Again, "THE MOST OVERTURNED COURT IN HISTORY"
And you are on intimate terms with the Queen, eh?   By the way, what is it exactly that that little thingy above signifies?   I hope I have used the right emotive whatchamacallit.
Neener neener - is it time to go in from the playground yet?
Personally, I believe that god doesn't exist, and I have a link, too!   By the way, sorry for all the links, but I have found that since creationism has been so well refuted elsewhere, I don't have to do too much work. It also helps that I'm presenting evidence, right?
And oddly enough you have been given several on silver platters. Perhaps you need to visit a neurologist and get checked for memory problems? Just to remind you once more - SICKLE CELL TRAIT is a mutation AND it benefits the phenotype under specific definable conditions. Do you really want to get hit about the head with that bat yet again?
I see. So the Bible is true because you claim it is true.
Oh!   Did you mean something like this in gun free France:   http://www.guardian.co.uk/internatio...ews+-+guardian   Those weapons were cheap and from an eastern block country. Machine guns are for sissy American felons. Real felons in gun free France use anti-tank weapons.
This must comfort you.
that's right, i don't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.
You must know a lot of Abortionist to make that claim. And Obviously they must have had you 'round for dinner to know how much they make and where they live. If you have so many Abortionist friends then why are you so anti choice?
Hey, thanks for the quote! Am I published now?
So, which is it? You don't want violators of Federal law to have guns, yet you don't want them to get rid of them either. Can't possibly do both, now can you? Which one? Do the law breakers keep them, or not? Make it against the law to keep the guns...now make it against the law to sell them. DUH! I guess we'll just hang out in limbo-land!
Because deer don't live in Africa.
Sure let me have your sermon/propaganda of misinformation since it doesn't match the context of the Scriptures.   propaganda   n : information that is spread for the purpose of promoting some cause.   mis·in·form  Pronunciation Key (msn-fÃ´rm)   tr.v. mis·in·formed, mis·in·form·ing, mis·in·forms   To provide with incorrect information.   con·text Pronunciation Key (kntkst) n.   1. The part of a text or statement that surrounds a particular word or passage and determines its meaning.   2. The circumstances in which an event occurs; a setting.   And since your "experience" does not guarantee you to be an expert I will stick to the context which matches what I have said.   Job 32: 4 And Elihu had waited for Job with words, because they were older than he in days. 5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, then his anger burned. 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and you are very aged; so I held back and was afraid to make my knowledge known to you. 7 I said, Days will speak, and many years will make wisdom known. 8 But it is a spirit in man giving them perception, even the breath of the Almighty. 9 It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged who perceive justice; 10 so then I say, Listen to me; I will declare my knowledge, I also.
Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want "guilty by association" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice.
Maybe He spoke very slowly.   Anyway, Creationism is not synonymous with Christianity. Literalists have a problem, not all Christians.
Edmund, you still haven't come out of that wardrobe.
We need to ban box cutters. We need to ban box cutter shows. We need to prohibit box cutters on school campus. We need to to ban extra efficient assault box cutters because the can open more boxes than regular boxes. We need to register all box cutters. We need to reduce the box cutter supply to prevent box cutters from getting to criminals. Regular people don't need box cutters, they can just use pointy sticks to cut tape on boxes.   Did you notice. They did not use guns. Terrorist in our country used box cutters and fertilizer and U-hauls to kill people.   We need to ban fertilizer and U-hauls.........
Sorry did I say pacifist?I meant yellow bellied pacifist.However if its any consolation, I meant anti's in general not just you Sinj.sorry if it sounded that way.
You mean Priests? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them, can't get enough of that catholic loving...
Actually it's all men.
And that's what scientists will do. No change there, then.   Now, on the subject of long-held religious views, how many so-called Christians will have a rethink when presented with new findings?
What makes you think I don't. Yours is not the only religion on earth!! And I didn't just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern, so don't jump to it with me.
Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it
Who cares?
And there we go again. Re-read the bit about dancing around the land mines, if you in fact did read it the first time.
Well, the short version is that shortly after the big bang, the universe was filled by a hot quark plasma. As it expanded and cooled, the process of nucleosynthesis produced the primordial elemental abundance, primarily hydrogen, with some deutirium, helium, and lithium. The physics is well understood, and verified by observation. Quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without Monte Carlo simulations   At roughly a billion years of age, stars and galaxies formed, some fraction of the stars that formed were massive supergiants, that burned up their hydrogen into other elements, up to the atomic number of iron. This occurred at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion years, these stars went supernova and exploded. Prior to going supernova, these stars go through a phase where the outer layers of the star are shed, providing ways to transport the lighter elements away from the star. You can see this in the following link:   Hubble Chemically Analyzes the Ring around Supernova 1987A   The trememdous radiation of the supernova permits the formation of elements with atomic numbers higher than iron. The force of these explosions scattered the newly created elements, creating vast gas and dust clouds. Eventually, the shockwave of another explosion initiated the collapse of one of these clouds, and the spinning hydrogen cloud begins to heat , eventually initiating nuclear fusion, and becoming our sun. As the sun began to increase it's heat output, the volatile remains of the accretion disk are driven away from the inner portion of the solar system, leaving mostly heavy elments. Comets bombarded the inner solar system, transporting water, carbon, and amino acids to the newly forming earth, making dirt.   In short, a truely wonderful creation.
Well any group or individual not spouting left-tard drivel is actually a hate group. The military is of such low intellect that they are easy to sway into hate groups. Hence the homeland insecurity warning on returning veterans.
No Christian sin??? Other then the intent to kill and then doing so
By far most speech about homosexuality from those who don't approve is not hate speech. You've been listening to too much propaganda from gay lobby groups who think demonizing and working toward persecuting Christians for their beliefs is the best means to an end. If Canada limited it's persecution only to those who are trying to change the law, there wouldn't be a problem.
And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be. I bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end.
Well, I see that Hunter continues with his intentional ignorance. Even though it has been explained to him on several occasions, he still chants his "evolution is only a theory" mantra in hopes that his audience will be as ignorant as he.   Yes, evolution is a theory. In science that means that it has been tested and accepted as essentially correct. Evolution is a theory just as gravity is a theory - several in fact; Newtonian gravity, general relativity, and quantum gravity. None of those theories actually work in all situations.   But for all practical purposes, evolution has been proven. That's easy since evolution has been observed and the theories are build on the facts of those observations.   You will notice that Hunter hasn't proven any of his assertions. He just knows that there are talking snakes, and magical beings that make people out of dirt. Sure - go ahead and start with the Bible so you can get the mythology of two different creation stories, an impossible flood, and such fantasies as a man being swallowed by a whale or the any human would know about a god that wagers with Satan, out of the way. Not only will you find no proof to support the Bible, you won't evern find any evidence.
But...but...   I just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the Ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. Now I'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   As to driving...don't care.   What I'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. There's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. You saying they can't do that?   But, that's just the argument Chem99a and I are having in another thread.   And this is what it devolves down into.   Parasite attached to a human and one that's coaxes it (often with governmental support) to nurish it...not much difference.   Personally, I'd rather have the sucker permanently attached to me so I'm not forced to think about feeding it or changing it's diaper. I'd also take a kick to the ribs over cholic crying.   Silly neglegence laws...   Yep.   I do think some would be willing to work towards compromises that would make the most happy. Jitobear seems to be one from my observations.   But, others want it their way.   I dislike abortion but can see in some circumstances that there really isn't much of an alternative. I also see that most anti-abortionists often don't help to provide alternatives.   I don't want to make it illegal per se but do want to work towards reducing the instrances in which a woman would see it as a more viable alternative.   It'd be nice if society and science would progress to that point.   But, since it isn't and since I'm evil(tm), kill it.   Go ahead...be a murderer.   Muahahahaha.   Evil WINS!   Go evil, go evil, go evil...   Um, isn't evil subjective?
Only if she's piloting at the same time.
Oh ye of little faith. I'm sure he's capable of being much more stupid than that!
Do you have a fire extinguisher in your house? I have never had a fire in my kitchen but I still keep a fire extinguisher in there. I look at wearing firearms for self defense the same way I look at wearing a seat belt. I wear it and pray I'll never need it, but I'll be damn glad I'm wearing it if I do need it.   God Bless
Oh no! Here comes Palin, run for cover.   Because I really fear ignorant and hypocritical conservatives. As to your argument, while were out calling fertilized eggs "men", lets call plant life "men" as well.
So if I come and insult and demonize you or somebody you love - you might still consider me a good person?
Those walking sperm will be funding your social security in the future, Matt. What will your sperm be doing besides causing stains?
Oh I'm so sure that's the case. "Well the economy's at the worst I've ever seen and I don't have a job and can't possibly provide a living for my family and we're in danger of losing our house and living on the streets, but I don't think I'll save us all a lot of pain and agony because I don't have a gun meaning that it'll just be too much work to kill ourselves."   Yeah right, like a lack of having a gun would've kept this family from dying in this instance. Your comments cheapen the value of life.
And by old fashion I assume you mean Greece a couple of thousand years ago. That's the only place and time I can think of off hand where the populace (by which I mean landed men in this case) could vote to change laws. In this country the correct procedure for a citizen to change an unjust law is via the courts, and always has been.   However, I don't think that is, in fact, what Jyoshu was refering to.
In other words youre happier because the old man did something criminal and broke the law.   Admit it.
Can your intellect explain infinity...such a tasty word
You need to learn what a metaphor is, if english is your first language you must have been dropped out of school as a baby.   When the researchers say plants "know" they are near their genetic cousins, they don't mean they have a conscious awareness of it and deliberately alter their growth patterns. That is, it is a specific physical response to a specific physical stimuli, and the plants could be made to do the same thing by the presentation of the same stimulus in the absence of any other plants.   Of course, you aren't interested in testing things, because that would be too materialist for you. You just prefer to skim articles and fail to understand metaphors, that's true "psychical science".
You got THAT right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So, it was a form of birth control?
Not necessarily. When "life" begins is irrelevant, because flowers and weeds don't have rights yet they are a life form. The thing that determines rights is intelligence. Not how much or how little, but whether someone has it at all. A spec of dirt has no intelligence. It won't pop up and say "hey! How ya doin!" unless you're on crack. We've actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy. We hunt, and we go to war. Even though I do not agree with war, I do agree with hunting, and I myself hunt on occasion. However, that is off topic. The point is, carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects, and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life. Its awful how she will have to liver her life. If she gets an abortion, the embryo does not (to quote another opinion) "mentally exist". Now, hunting is really only done for recreation, and maybe a good meal. They would've been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell. Sure, they'd prefer hunting, but its really only done for fun and exercise. I, myself, value an animal over an embryo at its current stage. The only reason I don't completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human. Then again, the animal does mentally exist and has full awareness, and the embryo is really just a sitting cellular watersack with no organs.
Well what do you expect?! Everytime gun owners try and do anything to combat crime, you liberal sissies yell and scream about vigilantism and foam at the mouth as you talk about how we're taking the law into our own hands and that we'll be administering death sentences without trials for matters as trivial as jaywalking!   You want us to combat crime, but you don't want us to actually do anything. Make up your mind already!
And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?
You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts.
Probably because buildings aren't biological or reproductive.
What, to be "open-minded?" or to embrace your definition of "tolerance?"
And the moon could fall from the sky, too.
Oh, well when you put it that way....   Maybe you could address this one thing.   "The total elimination of arms from society."   You'd think someone from Brady might have said this somewhere, sometime, that you could compare to the memo.   I would.
Oh, gee! There goes my irony meter. It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence. Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone.
Well, I think it is best to use a real source. Like the Australian FBI, called the A.I.C..   The latest figures. Violent crimes from 1996 to 2007 (per 100,000 persons per year)   Homicide is pretty much a flat line no? However there violent crime is not. And to be fair, Australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too.   So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat, but other violent crimes go up, then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down?
You go to hell when you do not ask for FORGIVENESS from your sins and ask Christ to govern your life and help you to stop sinning. I am still a sinner, but I am forgiven and I ask Christ daily to help me with my fleshly desires.
Golly gee. Scared already?
Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.
And you are proud of that?
Yes, with a crime rate larger than New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Las Vegas, they're a wonderful example to follow, aren't they?
Interesting how the study was set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They're a city known for violence and gang-related issues. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if those that were shot and counted in this "study" were known gang members who were either shot by their intended victims, or by other rival gang members.   Blah, blah, blah.   Stop throwing out discredited and biased stories. Explain in your own terms, exactly how having a gun makes you more likely to be shot. Explain the mechanics of how this works. Go on and try, make some sense rather than cherry picking poorly executed "studies" that prove nothing.   You made the claim that if you have a gun in your possession, this fact magnifies your chances of somehow being shot. What you suggest can only happen if magic somehow exists, like the legally-owned guns sends out powerful magnetic waves to attract the criminals and hypnotizes them to shoot in a situation that they normally wouldn't shoot.
Yes come over here and live in gun hating australia could you. THen when you call the cops after your father has been murdered and you kidnapped and torchered because you cannot have a gun for self defence you can wait 9 HOURS for the police to come and find your bloodied body lying on the ground. When you think of it 9 hours is not that long, I can fly from QLD to Japan in that, or play 3 baseball games back to back or run 3 marathons back to back. I am sure that somebody of your "intelligence" will have no problems with distracing some murders for 9 hours.   Why carnt US soldiers carry guns on base for self defense?   Please winston i cnallenge you to show us some cold hard facts that taking guns away from the law abiding drives crime down. Perhaps that family could have done it in the 9 hours it took for the police to come.
I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds.
I thought I'd give Brady and Penfold a chance to tell us what a bad man this guy was for defending himself like that.   BTW, here in Alaska he didn't need to have a concealed carry permit. Here, if you can legally own a gun you can carry it with a few exceptions.   Merry Christmas
Rofl… What were they supposed to do if they stayed in the egg longer with more time to feed off of it? Shrink?
I see. So what you are saying is that you are unsure about evolution and wish to explore it. Great. Then start with one of those unreasonable and dumb arguments and present it. Why are you more reasonable and not so dumb?   It's easy to do what you have done. I can claim that invisible pink unicorns push the moon across the sky. I can claim that you are unreasonable and dumb because you disagree with me. But it is meaningless unless I am willing to show that I have a pair and can step up and show why I am right.   Do you have a pair?
Am i stupid or something... whats a YEC? Young Energetic Children?   Yacking Economistic Critters Yummy expensive cupcakes?   Maybe im just dumb or something... i hope it was one of those three for my sake.
Mehhh.... You probably went to a Catholic school.   But now that you've stopped 'devoting' your 'life' to the God of the Bible, you've 'devoted' yourself to another god, Yourself. Typical case.
And I wasn't asked if I wanted my federal tax dollars to go towards hetero benefits and to support their walking sperm.
Please, I beg you, stop trying to jam the world into your "creation" account through reason. You just won't get anywhere through reason, if your first choice is to believe the bible (any religious works) as truth, and go from there.   What you just said is "[adaptation] would be mutation by natural selection, not evolution"   First, the adaptation refers to the adaptation of the species. A population of wingless beetles survives. The missing wings is the mutation, and isn't caused by anything other than a mutation, it's not a result of their being winds, or there being a god, it's just a mutation in the gene code.   The gene for the wings can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discarded mutations since those organisms that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age. It can also be left in the DNA sequence, unused, and not active, unless some other mutation activates it. ( A large percentage of our DNA seems to be unused garbage code).   When this happens, your species evolved. What is your point, that beetles can evolve? Yes, they do. All life on earth seems to. Yet you don't think it's due to evolution? Mind-boggling. Who is telling you evolution is "bad" or "wrong"? Only if you arrive at that conclusion WITHOUT religion, can you even begin to have a discussion on it.   Evolution in life only requires:   DNA replication   Mutations   A natural environment (that is, what we see here on earth, a complex system)   time   Which of these do you feel is "incorrect"? We can prove any of these, why persist?   -Mach
My money is on parents as singular.
So what is the bible then? Simply a nice story-book for you to read from?   If Genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution, what about the ten commandments?   It always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of Genesis or the Arc, but God really does hate the homosexuals. It says so in Leveticus, right? So it must be word perfect truth...   This bit about the origins of the earth? Oh, we just interpret that as god designing evolution. But that part about people burning in hell for eternity, that's true, right?
So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders.
You mean your hypothetical I presume? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal.   You're a bit slow I see.
So it is claimed.
Really? I have argued that God is an epic liar? Can you point out me arguing that at all you EPIC LIAR? Once again you are interpreting what I have said through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours, and then extrapolating that I am now arguing in favor of calling my God an EPIC LIAR. Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective?   I mean, how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man, because of our linear view of time, is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred, that God is then an epic liar? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation? Is He the liar? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space?   It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective, isn't it obvious child!   But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time.   Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space.   But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there.
Well Spam&amp;Scram is certainly the strangest of the anti-evolution crowd I've come across. He even proclaims that animals change as fact, not something that Creationists concede lightly.   He claims to know very little then decides he knows it all... (OK that's more like a Creationist.)   It might be intresting to see what happens if he came into contact with Creationists.
Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this "power," too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.
Just like you did with your astounding ignorance of erosion?   Fresh Organic Sample is just as old as centuries old time capsule because they are both on top of the ground!   Where do you buy your South American Villagers Dinosaur commercial art? I'd love to give some to the kids!
Wow! You really have been paying attention to the Democratic smear campaign of the healthcare insurance industry, haven&#8217;t you? Did you also pay attention to their relative profit margins VS those of other industries? It was 2.2% ROI!!! Banks make 10X that much and I don&#8217;t hear your demagoguery directed at them. In fact over 35 other industries make higher profits than health insurance companies.   Try doing some of your own research for a change and stop listening to DNC brainwashing. If they spent ½ of the time that they spend railing against the current healthcare insurance companies on something more pertinent, like shutting off the unlimited money supply to banks, this country would be able to pay for our, and probably Canada&#8217;s, healthcare.
I dunno, maybe it was in the third trimester?
Oh No, everyone! Our Mollusca has been undercut! Whatever shall we do?
wow, I never thought a qoute would be so stupid as to compare it to a house. Fine then what if I compare your head to a house that is housing ur brain. But it would be perfectly legal to rip it out and steamroll it on the street for allto see.   (by ur rules of course this would be a perfectly acceptable thing to do)
You repeat that like it actually means something! Could it that your side is paranoid looking for some vast Right Winged conspiracy?   Maybe it's Bush's fault!
Oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? GASP! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations. Just because their not closes binded right wing bigots doesn't mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different...
I'm not surprised that no one on your side of the debate would correct you, but wolves and dogs are both members of the same species. The Canid species, specifically the Gray Wolf, or the Canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.   The evolution of the domestic dog   The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places. Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations, and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool. A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22. The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.   In comparrison, the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative, the coyote, by about 4% of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24. Dogs are gray wolves, despite their diversity in size and proportion; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25. Link to source site:   http://www.idir.net/~wolf2dog/wayne2.htm   Here's a lineage graph:   http://www.idir.net/~wolf2dog/images/W2FIG4.gif   And what fossil records can you show that one species of animal has evolved into another species of animal?
http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html   Somehow merely clicking the link makes you look like a hypocrite.
You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death.
Wonder what "euthanization" is. Never heard of it before, and neither has the dictionary.
It was a pretty clear rebuttle of the idea that the ToE breeds social elitism, Marxism, and Nazisim.   I guess you're right though, SS. This wasn't nearly as entertaining as a slough of out-of-context quotes to show that ToE-accepting biologists reject the ToE.
So if everyone had a sign on them and a water pistol then would you be happier or does everyone need to have a gun? Should everyone who has a gun have a sign as well? Is the deterrent of a gun diminished without the sign?   I'm also not going to address my brother in every single post. He is a shining example of why I don't like guns but that doesn't mean I'm going to talk about him constantly.
Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?
**   It's up to you. Stop bringing up red herrings and/or arguing by personal attack, or don't expect me to treat your posts with any less contempt than I have for most of what's been posted to this board.
You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic? Talk about ABORTING.
lol...you read my whole post only to conclude with "what's your point." Evolutionist brilliance on display. I'm not mistaking nothing for nothing. I know my stuff. You obviously know nothing and don't care to learn it.
^ This is the funny part!....   My answer:   .45acp strapped to your hip... .05 seconds to respond to threat...   Crocidile Dundee's answer:   Call the police... 1-30 seconds to get to the phone.... 1-3 seconds to dial police (if you have 911) 30 Seconds to 5 minutes to splain yourself..... 5-30-??? time for police to respond..   My analysys:   Your dead!!!   Having the logic bus mow you down:   PRICELESS!!   (sorry Kelvin... COuld not resist!)
And from where did you get this idea? Please provide your references.
Because those who are pro life are against a womens right to own her own body. Her body her choice and none of anyone elses business. Remember control freaks are everywhere.
**   Back to the dark side,eh, and 'argument by personal attack upon the character of your opponent'?
But in terms of legality and constitutionality, do you believe that they should still be prohibited?   Also, how can god hate? I thought he was true love. Scratch that-- I thought he was unknowable.   Thanks
Because you say so?
Any proof that he was a murderous sociopath? It's your assertion...   I can't help but feel you're grasping at straws.
So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.
No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure.
So, how many kids do you have?   And, do you know their names? What they like to do?   It doesn't sound like you've been much of a dad if all you did is providing for them. Did you watch TV sports the rest of the time?
So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves.
So will they be in front of or behind a leaf?
**   I "pretend" to nothing. I am not "pretending" to beilieve you to be a materialit/darwinist. I do believe exactly that.   And as for your threat to make my arguments look silly, I'm not shaking in my boots. I've made your arguments look presumptuous, pretentious and silly, but you have never yet succeeded in doing that to any of mine.
So what's your solution, keep all blacks unarmed so the bad blacks can't hurt the good blacks?   I guess you've decided to drop your argument that the Second Amendment was a racist tool designed to keep blacks "in their place" under the thumb of their masters.
So which is it: the action is moral, the action is immoral, or there is no answer? You seem confused.
Stop telling me to look at the big picture when you've had both of your eyes gouged out!   Your entire statement here is beyond stupid. If the criminals felt that the only time to be armed was when their intended victims could fight back, then the criminals in DC would never be armed and the police wouldn't have needed to introduce gun shot sensors in the city. But since DC was the murder capital of the United States, that says an absence of hard targets isn't a guarantee that the abusers will play fair and not use weapons.
Just like it's the job of the gun control lobby to try and pass an overwhelming, unreasonable level of fear of an inanimate object?
Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't "really" a christian.
NO PERMIT IS REQUIRED IN VIRGINIA! You can legally carry a firearm there if you are legally allowed to own one.   Virginia performs an FBI background check and issues a permit UPON REQUEST for those who would like the convenience of carrying in another state that does require a permit.   This statistic is just those who have requested one! Imagine how many people who lawfully carry THAT HAVE NOT requested one! I would imagine the number of folks legally carrrying is WAY more that those who have went through the trouble of filing a request.   Yet, in THREE YEARS, people who lawfully carry a gun have "killed" 107 people?   OOOOOOH! Wow! So us legal carriers have committed one tenth of one percent of all gun "killings"? (Notice they don't say if these are justified or not.) Just to see how that looks - - - .01% - - There. That's how it looks:   .01%.   It's obvious why they don't compare this statistic to the average for the percentage of "killings" by the rest of the population who don't even carry guns.   Because it would show that "killings" by people who don't even carry guns outnumber "killings" by those who do by a HUGE margin.   The VPC can't have that now, can they? When you show the ENTIRE statistic, it makes gun carriers look SAFER than the regular population.   The HORROR! It would mean the VPC's point of view would be....uh....WRONG!
Do you have any evidence that this is so? Why would they be totally useless - is it just because you can't imagine a use?   Why do you think that a small, quick dinosaur with relatively long arms (not like the short useless arms of T. rex that couldn't even reach its mouth) with three very sharp claws would be useless? Look at this picture.   http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather18.jpg   Those don't look like totally useless masses to me. The problem is that you imagine that wings sprouted from nothing and must have been useless until they were fully formed as you think they should be. That's not the case. They didn't spring from nothing as useless masses. They were the front limbs, with quite impressively clawed, grasping hands. They could have even been used for climbing, as is the case of hoatzins that have claws on their wings until they get their primary flight feathers. The could have been used for grasping food that they were able to catch because of the speed assist from imprefectly formed wings.   You propose yet another "I just can't imagine how it happened so it must not be true" creationist argument.
And would you care to tell us just what those "official ideological goals" are and where we might find a certifiable copy of them?
And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.
How informative.
Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics. Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number. I am sure that IRS, GOD, and Hovind can work it all out.
Gee, Jo, you really should have read your sources. There is one part in here about the French 'navy' and Churchill you really should read
And the Violence Policy Center is somehow more trustworthy?
Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view.
Here's some advice, if you're going to try and crack on me, make your 'jokes' (I'll be nice and call them that) less passive and more active, grammar-wise.   Crim-   A definition is the meaning of word that someone created using their own opinions. Is there a difference?   And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle.
And ends with the woman, whose body is the one having to endure the pregnancy.
Oh they are? Thats strange... I could not find where exactly they stand on any of thier numerous websites, just more restrictions... And the old HCI was not "moderate"
probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.
BWAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH![/quote]So you are saying that my DNA reflects the fact that I live in Texas?
So SS. Please explain it all to me. Please show that you are not conclusion jumping and making unwarranted extrapolation based on poor understanding of the material. In other words, show me that you understand by explaining the research to me.   Thanks.
Funny. It is you who have "abso-freaking-lutely" no qualms about forcing gays and lesbians to pony up dough for Mr and Mrs. John Q Taxpayers marriage and divorce, all the whie denying them the chance to follow the same course as Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.   You my friend are a complete hypocrite. Either give them marriage or quite taxing them to help yours.   On another topic, I find it sad that you were ever given the position of moderator with your hateful and dishonest posts like this one. Very glad that it was stripped from you.
You make the supposition that before the NRA got to a politician that he/she was in a state of purity before.   Q: How can you tell when a politican is telling a lie?   A: When their lips move.
So the "Origin of Species" has more information for theistic evolutionists than the Bible does?? Does theistic evolution believe in Satan?
You have to be off for more than 4 days and after that I would get the princely sum of £79.15 per week..hardly worth having.   Unlike teachers I cannot stay at home and get paid when it snows too.
Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.
Is that the entire Pro-Choice objection? Is that the whole Pro-Choice argument? Does it really boil down to a question of pregnancy versus death, rather than slavery versus death? If so, I am Pro-Life.
Just another example of using a verse meant for personal use and applying it to wars. Sorry, just doesn't work that way.
Unfortunately, Michael Moore is a XXXXX. While a thousand gun control laws couldn't prevent 9-11, if there weren't ANY gun control laws, 9-11 would surely have been preventable. But, Michael Moore, being a XXXXX, would never be able to draw such a logical conclusion. It isn't "liberal" enough for his tastes.
Since always?
Just imagine Noah's checklist! There.
Well Nozz. I hear Canada or Mexico are looking for a few good(did I say good?)   men.   Kind of a dirty trick to pull on them though.
Oh really, so blowing yourself and a bunch of other innocent people up in the name of Allah is a "great teaching"?
Again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. Whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. It can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. Most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. Science can make no assertion as to what you saw. You may think it is wonderful, but LSD had that effect.   How strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. Actually, it's sad.
When is science going to get started on the book of Exodus? Job? Proverbs?
What illogical tripe.   The above is factually not true.   It's also the garbage that the Word of Faith movement hangs on to get people to conform to their message.   Seriously, I act like a 13 year old quite often...I only WISH I'd become one...simply becasue youth is wasted on the young.   I also act like a God. Flexing my might and power on a whim.   I'm still waiting for adoration and worship.   There is no 'act' there either IS or IS NOT.
Well... someone hasn't been following the campaigns for the so-called "protection of marriage" amendments, federal or state.
Yes, because although we trust our military with anti tank missiles, .50 machine guns, artillery, fighter planes, cruise missiles and even nuclear weapons, god knows you wouldn't want them parading around in public with a glock under their jacket unless they have renewed their permit in person.   I would have thought that people would have learned their lesson from the federal assault weapon ban. It was expensive to enforce, a major sore spot for a fairly large percentage of the population, and had no real positive effect, mainly due to the fact that it addressed no identifiable problem.   You expect such things from a liberal stronghold like california, a state with high crime that is always on the verge of bankruptcy, out of control labor costs, where they can't even keep the power on all the time becuase their environmental regulations are so rediculously stringent that the fiscal realities of building new powerplants are soo terrible that nobody would even consider it.   I thought people were more intelligent in your new state, George.
I see you Americans deal as loosely with the French and Spanish languages, as you do with English!   Surely it is something like Viva Libertad , or Vive la Liberte, but Viva La Liberty         ?????   Leo
So lets ban cars... They kill people... And think all the money could go to public transportation. Also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry... Don't forget archery... Can't have the subjects have any of that...   Since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses, Will the government be disarming too?   I see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman.
What about speculative and theoretical sciences? Is a circle 'real'?
Bertvan: Does this self-organization force “whip up” complex features intelligently and purposefully? Or does it “whip them up” by some unknown deterministic process in which creativity is somehow achieved by accident?
Your god is also the god of deceit. Why else would he erase all evidence of such a flood? Why erase the bones from the animals that must have died as the emigrated from the arks resting place? Answer those two and I'll have lots more
It also isn't a baby yet either. It is called a fetus.
You may not have intended to, but you've given your carte blanche support for a woman to do what ever with her she wishes, with regards to her family - and you'd stick out of it, regardless.   Also, interestingly, there's no man in this 'idealy free' family of yours.
Forgive me for laughing; no, not really ha, ha, ha ha ha   Could it be that people here as well as Canada and the rest of the world has figured out your infantile "grading system of States" is a complete sham and your very reason for existing is but an anti-constitutional farce and has lost any claims you have or will make? You stand alone now brady, with simply a few still clinging to the false hope of having others pay for your failures and unConstitutional stance so you can sit on your hands while you keep harping on overturning the 2A.
You ask others for their opinion, and then refuse to listen when it's offered.   The truth is that you don't see the analogy as valid.   We do.   We see a situation where, like blacks before, people disapprove of a group of people and want to segregate one group from the other.   Sometimes, they refuse to offer any alternative.   Sometimes, they offer a separate alternative.   That argument cuts both ways.   The question comes up regarding what's YOUR beef on the issue?   Why are you so insistent on maintaining two separate groups?   Is it because you want to reserve marriage as "prestigous" whereby gays are kept out?   Under interracial marriage, no black person was prohibited from marrying either.   Should people have been satisfied with interracial couples being classified as "civil unions"?   Today, we recognize that racism is wrong.   Yet some people still persist with homophobia. They fail to have a historical context on the real meaning of the methodology they recommend.   Frankly, that's like saying "You can't be Jewish, but you can pick any sect of Christianity you want to. You can't wear a star of david, but you can wear a cross.   So that's *equal*"...   You're saying we can marry HETEROSEXUALLY, so HOMOSEXUALS must pretend that's equal???   Makes no sense...   If I call somebody "male", that restricts no rights from them.   It doesn't require they go to a separate place to get their rights.   And quite frankly, insisting on keeping one definition FOR A RIGHT (at the exclusion of gays) is "satisfying the ego" of the homophobic group.   "attack on the definition of marriage"?   Why is it an "attack" to include gay couples in as married?   Would it be an "attack" on something for blacks to not have to be segregated from whites?
Did I claim you did start the thread? Vitroilic hatred, nope pity is the word you are needing there. No I merely pointed out your style of debate. Which I noticed you made no attempt to say it was wrong. Hence guilty as charged simone.   Yep that would be the left's method for free speech. Speech you don't want to hear is banned. On the flip side any conservative speech needs a liberal counterpoint. Am I right simone baby?
I think this is pretty much common sense. I think some study is in order, though. Everybody....put a sign in your window that says "This is a gun free home" and we will see if the incidents of robberies goes up among group memebers.
So it's the scientific community that sets up communication within a society, and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up? Hahaha – sorry but I'm not convinced.
You are FINALLY catching on. This is why we go to war against folks like Saddam regarding WMDs, or declare sanctions against Syria and Irans, but we do not go to war with the french or the british over WMD's. WMD's are inanimate objects, and we all know that inanimate objects are incapable of waging wars. We also know that instable governments and tyrannical leaders are fully capable of waging war, and have done so in the past.   It is good to see some of the GG's finally coming over to the side of comon sense!
It surely doesn't sound like he's a Nazi to me, but then again, I don't suffer from paranoid delusions either.
And who would pick the 'some'? Perhaps you also believe they should be placed on Ritilin...for their own protection...because their teachers (without medical training) diagnose the infamous ADD demon in them.   Not to get off topic too far, some teachers evidently have trouble recognizing the difference between students that can't seem to pay attention and themselves (the teachers) being in dire need of coming across as interesting.   What makes you think teachers or parents could ever become adept at recognizing who needs to put on birth control? Shall we wait 'til one becomes pregnant? Shall we offer a survey of sexual activities?...to what age group?
Oh yeah, like that hasn't been tried before /sarcasm It darn sure isn't about crime control. No doubt some nefarious excuse to farther control the people and attempt to charge user fees to discourage a right. No doubt sinjin will approve so "they" can match fingerprints and type of ammo to the DROS registration file?   The early birds get the worm After June, the best spots may already be taken and kalifornia laws will be shot down and they will be left with just what they claimed to want...nothing economical, an end to registration, people carrying loaded guns and buying cases of ammo out of State (no tax) while crying wa wa wa wa wa!   Don't forget Jerry Brown will probably have some changes of his own. Seems he is more pro rights and 2A than 'da terminator'.
Then their arguments are based on sheer ignorance.
gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?
You were asked to give us your explanation of evolution. So far you've just regurgitated creationist arguments against it, without showing that you actually understand what you're arguing against. But instead of trying to answer the question that was asked of you, you just spat out some more quotes. The least you could have done was to use quotes that explained evolution as you percieve it, but they're not even on topic, going on about morality and atheism! You continue to confirm your ignorance for us.
Oh - so you don't want to force me through pregnancy at any cost to me? You will let me make what decision is best for me? You will actually realize that I am in the best position to know?
Your stated stereotype of the person in the story is racist. It's a racist stereotype and you know it.   You're so entrenched in your own world and nothing outside of it, you wouldn't know the "truth" if came into your face like a lemon meringue pie.   Indeed the court's reasoning may have been as racist as your own.   Indeed, the article describes how the court's reasoning was even a surprise to the police officers' attorney because it was so out of line with what is expected of conduct during arrests.   She was not violent and she had an obvious health condition.   Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances.   I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer. Because you're a racist.   But it is o.k. for them to repeatedly break the law like yourself speeding again and again, as long as they sign the ticket.   What hogwash.   Actually, there is, my poor addle-minded friend. Indeed, you can argue that she was even exercising her responsibility as a citizen with more civic-mindedness than many because she non-violently and patiently refused to sign the ticket.   She has a right not to sign.   As H.D. Thoreau said to Emerson in jail, when Emerson said to him, "Henry why are you here?" -- Henry answered, "Ralph, why are you not?"   LOL. Well that's so nice of the copy who let you know. And that's very interesting -- "every time" -- Archangel. How many times have you been stopped? And for going how fast? I'm sure it was a lot more than 35 mph!   And you have the nerve to talk about "responsibility" or how this woman was a jerk?   Or to call me names?   Dearest, I never speed because I take my responsibilities as a citizen so seriously, and i have never received a speeding ticket.   Were you driving under the influence as well?   How many lives did you put at risk, Archangel?   What pomposity! What hypocrisy!
Yep. They're free to marry a member of the opposite sex just like any other American.
Really? I wasn't aware that the definition had changed. I do know that a definition was formulated as part of the modern synthesis back in the 1930s and 40s. That is the definition I learned some decades ago, it is the one I have always used, and it is the one that I still find in modern biology texts. It is also the one that all biologists that I know use, and of course the meaning definition of what evolutionary biologists mean when they talk about evolution should be determined by evolutionary biologists themselves. It seems kind of an empty exercise to invent a definition that isn't what evolutionary biologists mean and then argue against it in an effort to disprove evolution.   Let me put it this way, do you think that it would be acceptable in a discussion of Christianity if I were allowed to invent my own definition of what a Christian means when he talks about salvation?   So please, please tell us about some of these changing defintions. Like I said, I've been using the same one for over 40 years and wasn't aware that it had changed.
So god is unnatural?
Is there a defined number of posts he could make in the other threads so that you would consider them "finished"?
You forgot one. For trying to bring eugenics to the US. We wouldn't want those "poor negros" reproducing now would we?
You just say this because you want to murder helpless wromb-trapped human beings. You cannot just say you personally believe something in a debate.
Or, given that this is about feasts, a waist is a terrible thing to mind.
How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?
I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?
And here ladies and gentlemen we have the evidence of why I am justified in calling the likes of "stormboy" an XXXXX. The guy tries to discuss science when he is so utterly lacking in basic science that he thinks that the earth spins to "keep[s] the oceans from falling off towards the sun"...   stormboy, there is a thing called gravity: it is what "keep[s] the oceans from falling off towards the sun".   Now please go away and get an education, then when you have even the faintest idea of what you are talking about (which you currently do not), come back and attempt to debate. It will be for your own good as you are just making yourself look a prat by staying here.
Oh, just come right out and say it, women are subhuman, all they are is wombs.   Come on, let's show the true colors of the pro-fetus movement.
oh brother.. so what if a minority of americans wanted to legalize murder.   this is rediculous.
Oh! mememe! I have an idea!   The museum staff hire (or possibly abduct) a few evolutionists and put them in stocks. The visiting kids then come to the gallery to give Mum and Dad a break for an hour and get to ask the scientists questions about the origin of the earth and why fossils are different from things alive today. Each time an evolutionist gives an answer based on science they get pelted with the leftover veg from the dino pit lunchtime display. This way the kids learn an important lesson in how to deal with scientists as well as being good for the environment by putting all that veg the dinos wouldn't eat to good use! Yay!
The comment of someone with an IQ of about 48.   Ray M.
Excuse me, I stand corrected. For 'pretend' please substitute 'wrongly believe'.
Yes, and those apartments are frequently broken into, in the broad daylight, because criminals know that they won't be harmed.
Oh dear, you are one of those people: a "twit absolutist" as you might say. Please keep your silly "ism" labels to yourself.   "Moral relativist" is like "rectangular square": it's a tautology.
Quick question -   What particular qualification of Dr. Olson's makes his opinion on the subject superior to all others?   Given your fondness for posting this essay of his (in his entirety) as your ultimate justification, that should be an easy one for you.   Waxy
People make mistakes (excepting some pro-evolutionists who respond with anger and blame others of 'twisting their words'.)
The point is that these laws against cheaply manufactured handguns are no more than economic restrictions on gun ownership. This is similar to old english laws which established actual economic requirements for owning weapons. Gun accidents happening due only to poor construction are rare. This is just another form of people control, keeping weapons out of the hands of the poor so as to lessen their importance in politics. "Screw them, they can't do anything about it."
Just to be pedantic, a better analogy would be: "If you are here, why do you have brothers and sisters?"
which is pretty much the same thing. The majority of representatives get their way. The representatives are elected by a majority. Being overally picky about it gets you no where...we pretty much have a majority rules nation.   And we still haven't settled the question about how you think you can impose your belief on others but I can't. The "convention" idea didn't work, the idea that you aren't imposing a belief on others didn't work, so what is next?
Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean "my ultimate agenda"? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore "well regulate." Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, " 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia." Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that "The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia." Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned "saturday night special." My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?
Seriously?   That's your reasoning?   By such logic, swimming with sharks means that humans always have coexisted with sharks, including the ancient ones that preceded the dinosaurs. By such logic, since humans can coexist with insects, we must have been around during the carboniferous period.
So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?
Actually when you read every thing you have to rationalize (lie) what God actually did, for God was done with everything then started again. THe stories don't parallel each other they intersect.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if, in this male-centered world, drugs were designed to be women-friendly, especially pregnant women-friendly?
Yippie doo! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view. And his point of view has (or had) merit. But since then, several feathered dinosaurs (not birds) have been found. It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation. (You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a "point mutation" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation.
So, we on this board aren't receptive to your proselytizing? Sorry about that. This particular forum is intended to be a scientific discussion, based on logic and evidence. We certainly don't want to waste your time. The door is over there. I find your dismissive, superior attitude to be offensive, to be honest., so I can't say I'll miss you.   But should you ever want to discuss evolution and creation in terms of actual science you will be welcome to return.
Recall I mentioned your use of hyperbole earlier? its in that sentence as well
At your service:   Comparison   I could've just circled the whole thing, but this makes it clearer. Plus it's overall body shape is "fatter"

Yeah, a license to murder the unborn...........
Why do 14 bus loads, 500 SCIU members, need 2 Police squad cars from DC to protect them from 1 Home owner?   Fishy? I don't think so! I think the COPS were there to Intimidate the one home owner, just like SEIU was there to do! Cops! Of all things, they used Washington DC COPS! Cops!   No? What am I missing?   Makes one wonder if things got out of hand and the protesters started throwing rocks through the window, and if the terrified home owner would have stepped out with a fire arm, am I wrong to think that the DC police would have shot the home owner? Seriously What the heck gives? Cops! Part of the angry mob?   If nothing else, 500 people trashed this guys lawn! That is for sure.   Am I missing something here, or am I correct to think that we have totally degenerated into Chicago style intimidation politics? See the video for reasons why I believe this.
So if genesis can't explain some things then it is false?   Ok, genesis, and all you theologians out there, a quick question off the top of my head.   Using only scripture, please explain why dinosaurs are extinct.
Don't like it when the person you're arguing against can be as sarcastic as you are, huh? I understand, I get these types of whines all the time.   thistownwilleat-
I believe murder is wrong, and there shouldn't be any of it in a perfect world, but i'm not going to force my morality down your throat and force you to abide to MY principals while demanding you abandon your own.   But it's not about me, it's about the person being killed.   Think about it.
I think I hear a bell dinging!! Ding! Ding! Let the round begin. Your giving me the invite, and I'm willing to take it.   Now I'm not going to make any comments on your ex, or whatever he is to you. Because I don't know him enough to assume anything about him. But I will make general statements on the effects of gay marriages on children.   I have seen so many documents, on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation, because of living i the house with their gay parents. On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself. But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men.   A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay.   Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1% of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine. But the majority suffers, and that far outweighs the few that don't suffer because of having gay parents.
Perfect. A creationists caught repeating the same refuted arguments on different forums. Resistance is met, run like a coward to another forum.
So long as they do not contain my DNA, yes.
So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed?
Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence. You mean like Bill Ayers (sic) and his wife or Carl Rowen? Wait my bad they aren't from the right.
You think it was Me? You are yet again, confused. I don't even know what a DROS is. Department of Registration Ohio State? That would be my best guess, seeing that I am from Ohio!

If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.
Amen !! Punish the whore !   If she would have just had the kid she would discover what we all know ... That the child would have been loved and protected given a nurturing home by her because she isn't really smart enough to know what she wants.   She MUST have the kid , when it arrives all will be well !! We just know it !
oh please dont give me that XXXX... its so great that you can try to turn that whole statement and point at me being at fault but that in and of itself shows you are at fault because you think that without your way the world would cease. Honestly, the world has lived without gay marriage its whole existence.... so why implement it now?? SHouldnt that say something about the human race when it steeps so low to want to call homosexuals married couples?
To Clive14:   Darwin never produced a "Theory of Human Evolution".   R--i--g--h--t. And I'm a Shakespearean act--o--r. Darwin's book titled "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life" sure seems to me to suggest that he had an idea on the evolution of man. Darwinian evolution was (and still is) inherently a racist philosophy, teaching that different groups or "races" of people evolved at different times and rates, so some groups are more like their ape-like ancestors than others. Darwin believed, for instance, that the Australian Aboriginals were considered the missing links between an ape-like ancestor and the rest of mankind". Many indigenous peoples died because of Darwinian evolution, so don't give me such rubbish that Darwin never did a theory of human evolution.   Darwin's evolutionary scheme went something like this:   Evolutionary ancestor --> Australoid --> Negroid --> Mongoloid --> Caucasoid.   Perhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such a remark. And people think that creationists are mis-informed!   This is true of the unscientific use of the word "theory". In science, "theory" is equivalent to "fact". There is a theory of gravity for example. Is gravity just guesswork therefore?   Once again, falsehood. If a theory is equivalent to fact, than why do they have two different things. In science, using you above example, gravity is a fact (I don't think that there is a theory of gravity, at least it is not in the HSC Physics course when we were studying it!). By definition, a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation. Now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied? Now where, a theory is like a story to explain observed facts and phenomenon. A theory does not mean the idea is "fact". It is just a story used to explain how some observed phenomenon may have either came into existence, or why and how it behaves the way it does. You mis-interpretation of scientific terms is noted.   I disagree. Faith is believing something to be true regardless of the evidence. People have faith in the Bible. People do not (or should not) have faith in evolution.   I agree with your definition of faith. Bible believing creationists must take it by faith that there is a God, and that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God. Evolutionists (for the most part, i.e. most are atheistic), however, must take it by blind faith that there is no God and that the Bible is not the Inspired Word of God.   Your last sentence struck me as to how brainwashed some (or many people) are in the lie of evolution (microorganism into people evolution). For one, evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff has evolved, i.e. there is very few fossils that support this notion. The fossil record dismisses and is a crushing critque of Darwinian evolution. For example, Dr Ronald R. West (paleoecology and geology) stated in his article "Paleoecology and uniformitarianism" which was published in Compass, vol.45, May 1968, p. 216:   "Contrary to what most scientists write, the fossil record does not support the Darwinian theory of evolution [microorganism to man] because it is this theory (there are several) which we use to interpret the fossil record. By doing so we are guilty of circular reasoning if we then say the fossil record supports this theory."   In addition to this, Dr David B. Kitts (School of Geology and Geophysics, Department of History of Science) in his article "Paleontology and evolutionary theory" in Evolution, vol. 28, September 1974, p. 467 says the following:   "Despite the bright promise that paleonotlogy provides a means of "seeing" evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists the most notorious of which is the presence of "gaps" in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them. The gaps must therefore be a contingent feature of the record."   What they are saying is that the fossil record does not show evolution, but we will continue to believe it even though we have no proof of the theory of evolution (i.e. microorganism to man evolution).   Evolution has been proven. Creation has been disproven. This whole argument is over stubbornness on the part of people with faith who cannot bring themselves to accept that evolution has been proven and creation has been disproven.   Four words that always gets an evolutionist into trouble, "Evolution has been proven". If you refer to what you call "micro-evolution" (to which creationists call "Varriation within a "kind"") than I would agree with you. Species change all of the time, but it is important to know that the species never get more complex, they are constantly losing gentic information (i.e. DNA) and becoming less complex. With natural selection, things lose an ability that will enable a species to survive in an environment (usually by the way of mutations). So since varriation within a kind (or micro-evolution - always a loss of DNA) has been proved, this is also further evidence to the creationary model. The macro-evolution has not been proven. Nor does the fossil record bear out many evidences for this, as many leading evolutionary scientists have (or are comming) to realise.   Creation has not been disproven, as you falsely claim. Otherwise, the evolutionists here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist arguments, and thus far they have not. This fact alone is evidence against you. They only gain an advantage when we start having silly debates on things that I do not know much on, nor have studied up on, such as geological features for an example. We have the same rocks, so of course the evolutionists are going to claim that in many cases I am wrong - as they have a different interpretation to me. Or they have a different story to explain who a land structure got there to me. Both stories are based on the evidence, so it is hard to get through to one another. Sadly, time restricts me from continuing.
This topic was discussed in another thread. Kelvin said that-   "If it were not the private ownership of guns in 1941, you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the Westcoast, German if you live on the Eastcoast."   Urban Legend. It should be illegal for women to have sex.
um... gee... its killing a baby... now.. before 8 weeks, its not in the form of a human being.. at 4 weeks, its a fish.. at 5.. its a rodent.. but after 8.. its in the shape of a human... there is no way around that fact.
All sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you.
I didn't mention evolution in this topic.   You did.
And the resemblance of the bill of a platypus to that of a duck is superficial. You don't actually try to learn the basic facts about anything before you speak out, do you?
I'd be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who doesn't even believe in what they're selling. Those teachers may teach it, but they don't believe in it.
The ATF declared both .30 cal M2 AP and 5.56mm M855 Ball (w/steel penetrator) to be "non-AP" rounds.   For those of you that have a problem with law abiding citizens having and using "AP" ammo....wake up! We ARE law abiding so what are you worried about.....or do you think I don't "need" it? If so..who are you to tell me what I "need"?   I have a rifle match next month...I think I'll go load up some AP for it since AP tends to shoot better in my M1 than regular Ball. :D
So taking peoples rights away is an american value? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal. After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also.
Actually yes, but not for the purposes of ilegal search or seisure, I have active duty military friends. They drop by all the time. Obviously your great lack of friends makes that idea hard to understand.
So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.
Why you quoted me is questionable. What I posted was merely a series of mathematical equations proving that Hovind is completely full of ****. How you consider mathematical equations "mockery" I don't know, but more likely, you did not bother to watch the video. Instead, in your normal fashion, you simply ASSUMED what you wanted to believe and then went from there rather then actually looking at what it was and what it had to say.   Your post more accurately is towards the link that AA posted in defense of his beliefs (yet failed to realize was satirizing those beliefs). Furthermore, I'm not an atheist even though your poor definition wants me to be.
Read THIS slower:
That money will never be paid. "Doctor" Hovind (his doctorate is from an unaccredited diploma mill) has phrased his offer in such a way that it is impossible to get it.   Numbers 1-4 have absolutely nothing to do with evolution, but gullable people fall for it. Number 1 is actually impossible to prove.   Hovind probably doesn't even have $250,000. In 1996 he declared bankruptcy, and there's no reason to believe that his financial situation has suddenly improved. He claims that "a wealthy friend", whom he refuses to name, has the money. The committee that is supposed to evaluate claims is similarly anonymous, but he has hinted that it's filled exclusively with creationists, who are certainly not unbiased.   Read about Kent Hovind. He really is a worthless piece of scum.
That "somebody" was a Jesuit priest, the idea met some initial resistance because of it's religious overtones. But the overwhelming evidence in favor of it carried the day. You should study some history too.
Try the link. You've done the 'name calling', at least you could be honest about what you are doing.
That's great for women!   What about the rights of their children?
Well, it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution. One doesn't expect Creationists to possess it.
Therefore you accept that the Republican party almost as a whole is "grade A USDA approved Liberalism." About time you did.   
More chattering from the peanut gallery? Haven't gotten the memo, you're no longer a player? Honestly....clamoring for attention is so low budget. No shame.
Yep, suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go. We should also get them to stop pooping.
I guess we all missed your point Justine, whatever it might have been. emoticonXConfused Better luck next time. emoticonXGood
Evidence, I dont need no sticking evidence. This is what I beleive, and thats it, but I will dig up some proof that supports my point.
And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.
What is it that you disagree with? My statement of fact? Or the fact that I made a politically incorrect assertion? emoticonXConfused   
Tell you what-get your math and science skills up to a grade 6 level and I'll consider taking advice from you, 'kay?  
In my case, it isn't 'god fearing'.. so much as "believer fearing'
yeah just like you and your idols Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, etc.
HOLY COW!!!! Is this the "Sacred Institution of Marriage" you and jyoshu are so fervent to protect?
So a gun is a fire hazard in a public place? I gotta say the gun haters are getting more creative with their arguments.
Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained.
Wow, everyone's just shakin' in their boots that your imaginary god will magick them off the earth! emoticonXKillemoticonXKillemoticonXKillemoticonXBanghead
Quite amusing that you refer to westerners as Gringos. The last time I heard that was in a film about Pancho villa!
It looks like just Mucusaur, you and me, along with an entire thread of bots! (I'm not too sure about Mucusaur, to be honest!) ;)
Ah, historical inevitability. I had no idea you were a marxist, Steeeeve! Unfortunately for you the same argument applies to the collapse of capitalism. And once again you conflate capitalism and freedom. Have you never heard of anarcho-syndicalism? And why is someone more free when their life is controlled by corporations than when those corporations are restrained by a democratic government?
I have no idea what "women's rights" might be either. You could try to explain that to me while you are at it.
Says the one who calls everyone who disagrees with him about politics a "Bush hater" and then cowardly runs away. emoticonXRolleyes
You can thank Slick Willie Clinton who pushed through the sub-prime lending fiasco that eventually blew up under Bush. And gay-boy Barney Franks who oversaw the program.  
Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right.
Look, the "no one was around to see it" argument. "If a tree falls in the woods, and no one was around to see it, did it really fall?" You lost this one a long time ago, too. You never learn.  
Well, this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum, it is likely, he'd be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe'd actually be contributing to the pro-choice position...
Another red herring gay argument. Ever hear of a medical power of attorney? You don't need marriage to have one, you know. emoticonXRolleyes   
  Anyone wanna make any bets on who the newbie is here???
Doctor, not guy/gal. Say the words...... A doctor.   Baby is synonymous with infant. Is fetus synonymous with infant? Strange, isn't it?
Dude, it's, like, all over the Bible, man! Maybe if you hit your forehead with Bibles more often, you would know these things!
Wow, that must be some good stuff he was drinking to keep him 'under the influence' for THAT long!! :p
Lets all make vast generalizations that are not true. Seems fun emoticonXRolleyes
That must be why they like to wear boots in Texas.
Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that "evolution" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance.
So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot.
No but it will be funny to see what sex tapes this tramp did too....
Yes, it doesn't agree with your agenda so it must be trolling.   
Apparently someone doesn't read. Trebor was talking about me not being jewish in the following quote.  
Probably neat excuse. Do you expect jim to back that claim up? emoticonXGood Don't hold your breath.
We all agree that abortion is "killing". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open "mind". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead.
Excuse me?! Didn't AIDS started because your homies either ate or did the nasty with monkeys, thereby crossing the species boundary? What did it have to do with "da man"? And crime and poverty in Africa is also the white devil's doing? emoticonXConfused  
It probably was a bunny suit that he was supposed to wear. I guess he changed his mind, once again, and decided to wear this suit.
THe religious reigh is not mainstream either. And frankly, you are also confusing politics and religion. You do KNOW that there is a difference? You also know there is a differnece between hateful proclimations and scholarship, don't you??
I'm not going anywhere with this thread. I just wanted to point out the obvious hypocrisy of everything your side represents, and nothing more. You all go right ahead and massage your shallow World views.
Well, I guess you got something there. . . . . .can't put the cart before the hose!!
The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.
So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about.
We came from apes not created. Why can't people figure that out did any body go to school around here.

Well, when the people who market prayer come up with evidence that it works as described, let us know! As a meditation technique, it might work fine, who knows, but then, so do many other methods.

so if right now, i ask god for forgivness, someone kills me, i will go to heaven by default? makes sense to me, i mean, i dont have time to sin...
Not quite sure what you are talking about, Iangb. And I really don't have time to crack the code so if you have a specific question, just ask it already.
  Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?  
When do you advocate breeding blond haired, blue eyed citizens to purify the US?
that's right, i don't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.

You question others sources and credibility yet you parade around under the name of a giant cartoon Shake?
* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)
And yet here we are and neo-Darwinism continues to have empirical support right and left with no sign of it being falsified in sight as of yet. Why might that be? And you Bertvan do not exist since you are so highly improbable. Therefore I can safely assume that your post above just happened without your existense.

Yeah, so will slaves who don't know their Biblical place under their masters, and women who don't submit to men.
So you haven't got an answer to the question and prove that you are 'busted'.. That's OK...as long as we can all see that.
You wouldn't. More likely you'll pursue your Wiccan follies until Judgment Day and then wonder what hit you.
If I had said that, I would have been wrong. But the fact is that I didn't say that. You seem to have a problem in undertanding English. Let me help. Here is what I said:

Yeeees, that's why option 4 as I wrote it says "reinterpret" as opposed to "reject."   Having a bad reading day, eh?
It also isn't a baby yet either. It is called a fetus.
You already screwed them over when you decided to cover their country in radioactive dust. Depleted uranium is a real bitch.  
You know my answer: There is no god and no one "created" mankind. But the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under "Religious" or "Philosophy" section, not abortion.   Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?
No, you at least need a sling shot and ball bearings, lol.
And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell.
And like I said, your opinion is worth exactly NOTHING. emoticonXRolleyes

Well you wouldn't have to 5hit yourself everytime you walked down the streets if you had a gun yourself.
Your problem is that you take the Bible as the Literal Word of the Invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is NOT. There are other "Sins' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as I that Jesus did not change the Laws. If you want others to live by your False book of fairy tales it would be a Good Idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first. Choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish.  
Good news. It seems as time goes on Arizona attempts to become more and more intolerant and bigoted. Thankfully he put an end to this one (too bad not the immigration one).

So you are saying that we determine our DNA? Do you actually think before typing?
Ha.a.a.a :p emoticonXGood Good one, sinjin.  What is the sound of one hand clapping.....?  Ladywolf,  Your answer will probably come from many different sources. Your idea that it evolved is pretty-much it, IMO.
Oh, look, removing a quote from its context. How about your address my textbook definition next?  
Only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakicetus_(1).jpg  Replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why I put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy.
Is this a rational statement? If so, prove it rationally, by science.
Let me return the kindness. The correct spelling is ==> especially   
It is only difficult to sort out if you are a neocon and fail to recognize that neocons are nothing but militant liberals.   Bush was BY FAR the most liberal president we have had for at least 20 years.   Maybe you need to research traditional conservative values.
What, pray, is a real answer? Because, you know, if it is anything like a corrcect answer you are doing a rather poor job of it, mate.
The riddles continue? emoticonXConfused Wouldn't it have taken less time and have been less ambiguous if you or Dr Spock just posted the # of the post?emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes
My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.
Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the "right" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say "All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages". Since we have "a government for the people by the people", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people. You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else.
Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions?   Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?
Yup. Give me an example of a true inaccuracy, instead of working to poke fun. Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures. Are you scared because you see the "ancients" commenting on subjects you thought science had "discovered" since the "enlightenment"? Man, how arrogant can you get? You remind me of the Pharasees. Arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend. Either explain how the Bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above, or don't bother posting.
Hmmm, a mere human-mother cannot make decisions concerning her own body, but you, sk8joyful, can usurp the position of God and tell another human, especially a mere human-mother, what she is allowed to do with her body.
Me, too. I'd probably throw in some counseling as well, just for starters.
Including the mentally ill, those with previous violent felonies, and children?
And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said, "There can be no liberty without virtue." Someone else once said, "Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings".   If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - "The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur.
If it isn't so hard then why haven't you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.
Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes   I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away.
Well then, using just the Bible, what is the value of pi to the third decimal point?
Nice spin. Would you have preferred "the civilized world" instead? Or Western Civilization or Gay Western Civilization? Your preference? One case in 1959 isn't a pandemic.   
Oh spare me the condemnation ya' XXXX-hard. You aren't interested in saving souls. If you were, you would bother to have payed attention to the countless times you have been told that your abrasive, insulting tactics DON'T WORK.   Plus an eternity in hell or an eternity with a terroristic God? I think I will stick with being able to live with myself for even today, let alone an eternity.  
The fact that you think the 9-9-9 plan is good only proves you are as stupid as Herman Cain is. Maybe you and Grover Norquist can get with Herman Cain and start construction on Utopian dreamworld, and don't forget to stop by and pick up your other dumbass Ron Paul on your way .
This just goes to prove that these nasty gays are maliciously infiltrating the military far more than we suspected (anyone would think they want to defend the country or something). But no, they just want to infect them with nasty squiggly crawly things. EEeew!! Look the SEALS must be a bunch of raving deviants. Quick, club the lot of them before this thing spreads.emoticonXRolleyes   Er . . . *puts down burning cross and slinks into shadow*
He didn't pursue the "master race of white Protestant." He was a pure Aryanist, genius one. The very least you could do is get your facts straight, but you probably like spreading this bullcrap on purpose. (Seeing as how you're an atheist.)
Yeah guess that probably makes me a gun-toten redneck drunk,shooten everything in sight huh.emoticonXKillemoticonXGood
And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?
You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic? Talk about ABORTING.
I thought you had vowed never to post in this forum again. ????? I suppose with your views on divorce, your wedding vows have as much weight as your vow not to post here.
Wow that worked well. Please explain where his logic is flawed in the point he made. You cant, because its not. This just proves how much this "point" along with all your other arguments have "flaws in logic" if you will.

Um no... It's the truth... Um, I guess it was sarcasm, but I don't think that would be something that you would understand.
I suppose if you Truly Believe its not dishonest to repeat anothers ideas as if they were your own. I will keep this in mind the next time I have to write a paper. Woe betide any professor who accuses me of plagiarism, for he is trampling my religious freedoms!  
Pure conjecture on your part. As a father of three, I have as much vested interest in my kids as my wife has. To suggest otherwise is BS. But, maybe you don't understand that because you haven't walked a mile in a father's shoes. emoticonXRolleyes
I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?
I won't waste my time with trolls here. Do you have anything useful to say?
I see you've met my stalker. Lovely soul, isn't s/he? ;)
That's like looking at a rainbow and insisting it only has the color red in it.  
Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile.

Is it not extremely cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not suffer from hypothermia due to the extreme cold at 35,000 feet? Did he not fall from the sky and break near all his bones when the wheel well opened for landing after a lengthy flight at 35,000 feet? Do I have to give you the flight number and type of airplane in order to get my stuffed animal circus prize?
Well are there 4 or are there none? What about the Archaeopteryx lineage, why do you keep avoiding the question by changing the subject? It's no wonder scientists get annoyed with creationists.
Really. If that's being "saved," I prefer to go down with the Titanic.
Sheeple never understand where money comes from nor do they know cliffs even exist. Full bellies, breeding, mindless entertainment and a government sheppard are their sole requirements.
Already busted, Mr. Trebor. Went in one eye and out the other. Come back when you have something other than generalized rhetoric.
He wasn't trying to. Shooterandproud may be an unreasonable gun nut, but he accepts evolution.
No, you wouldn't have. I'd have a better chance of winning the lottery without buying a ticket.
Well since Bush took office the mantra has bee "Local Control" has it not. Apparently the people of your state want whats happening. Local control in action. Rejoice in your victory.

So which argument do you want to stick with/ The one above that says the black vote was irrelevent or your previous argument in which you claimed was significant. I'll refresh your memory::  
Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one.
You are so FUN. Its amazing to hear you say this considering how much you applaud a law that pretty much allows this in Arizona.

How about not clicking the "reply " button twice (heh,heh,) No, we didn't (Thank goodness) AND! PM Blair is recanting from the Kyoto protocol. Bully for him!
I have no problem with them preaching against gays in their churches and the privacy of thier homes. Its when they crawl out from under their rocks that I have a problem. I also have absolutly no problem what so ever with them talking about Jesus if only they would keep to the subject of Jesus and leave all gay issues alone. Unfortually Paul has replaced Jesus in many churches.
Aaahhh, so just not accomplishing our goals and going home is not defeat, there has to be paperwork for it to be a defeat. Gotcha.   
And you wonder why people call "republicans" racist, women hating bigots. (hint: it's comments like yours)

Yes, we should have a speedier route to the needle. If we miss a few, send a few innocent people to their deaths, no harm no foul.
You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death.
And the scientific papers don't. The problem here is that creationists don't read the scientific papers. In fact, most can't even understand them.
Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?
I sincerely doubt any of that happened. If so you would have links. Yea we know you are cyber brave to the point of heroine status. You are a troll pure and simple.

Nice try. Now, tell me how atheists are paying for "Christian benefits"? Do Canadians give money to people based on their religion? They surely don't here in the States. I can only collect SS if I pay into the system. My employer AND I pay for my family's healthcare. As for their tax-free status, I would have no problem removing it...just as I'd love to see the ACLU and other crackpot liberal organizations lose their tax-exempt status. emoticonXGood   
Oh vey! Vat du they say about the U.S. Marshals service committing more crimes than people they have actually arrested for a crime?
So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?  The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.  It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.
Yes I apologize for your ignorance and your inability to 'get it'....   
But in all reality an embryo is inside a uterus, living solely through a placenta and a two month old baby is not. That is a significant difference. One may argue how significant, but it is silly to say the only difference is time.
That's good - so you no longer believe all actions that result in inevitable deaths are killings, only cruel ones. This is an improvement on your previous:  
Yes, but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper. Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that!
And then you can go pat yourself on the back and pretend it's all better. I hope your personal comfort level will be worth the havoc that will be brought upon the lives of women.
That is the greatest monologue in the history of Earth. Instead of a resume, I will just fax this to my next prospective employer.   Great stuff.
When's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher?

You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:  Question: Was Stalin a communist ?  Answer: That's what he said he was.  Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.
I'm sorry, did Article V have a clause I'm missing that says you can only amendment the constitution if it accomplishes more freedom? Is there anywhere in the history of that provision that supports this? Can you point to ANYTHING that supports your incorrect viewpoint?

Yep, so much for a pastor knowing his sheep(le).  It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.  What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???  As to this case.  I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.  But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock.

The last known passenger pigeon died in 1914. Your attempt to inflame the discussion fails on the grounds of utter stupidity. Might as well be asking if he bagged a tasmanian tiger, or a chupacabra, or the mothman.
Well if you already know you're for guns, then you should know the basic reasons, right? Or was this an uninformed decisions (I heard from my friend that guns are good)? But basically other people have said it. They're protected by the Constitution, they generally result in lower crime rates, and they can be used for defense as well as hunting. Oh, but the burden of proof isn't on the people supporting guns, but those who wish to ban guns. Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable.
The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust.
Do you think that red herrings and strawmen will help your case? ;)

Oh but he is different in the mule's tiny mind. The Southern Baptist types are Christian and so uphold the mule's way of life, so it's alright for them to call for mass death.
So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?
No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word "prayer?" Why not?

And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true. But that doesn't make mythology true.
Your definition of "Godly wisdom" is agreeing with your political positions and your spurious theological justifications for them, so it's hardly surprising you don't encounter any liberals who you think have "Godly wisdom"

Well then the courts must be insane. Because I'm sure there are some gun control laws that they're struck down due to their ineffectiveness.
How do they use "the empirical evidence prove it", when they do no research, and no evidence actually supports their "theory"?

Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!
Poor little poopie.   If your gay sex agenda wasn't of the devil himself you might be better received in the world.
If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.
It ok if one persons bottle is bigger or do they kinda have to be roughly equal in size? really.
With a standing president breaking the law to 'protect' you, this should be expected.
Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.

Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that "...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed." Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts.

And we all know when you say "We" you mean your buddies the Mormons and their Money are the ones voting down such bills.. It's just a matter of time before people start to wake up.

I'm a redneck because, unlike you, I believe in self-determination?! emoticonXWow
Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.
Numbers don't lie, unless they come out of the mouth of a Politican.
You're lying to yourself.. So I'll just keep letting you know until the cloud of delusion dissipates.  
Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.
Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about.
Because there couldn't possibly be any undetected illegal gun trafficking, could there be?  
WOW and the republicans would never do anything like that now would they.......They would never impeach a president over a BJ now would they?
Where is your "proof" that a magical being in the Heavens created us ?
If we could rub a brass lamp, make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately, I'd agree with you. But since we live in the REAL WORLD, we must become OIL INDEPENDENT while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources.
Yeah, right, JO, socialist countries are Eden Mecca's all over the world today. No matter how many times they fail, its proponents just need another chance.
Oh my goodness, yes. I had forgotten that scenario. How silly of me.
So you see a cop on the streets, you see he's armed, that's enough to induce aggression and violence, possibly cause you to hurt others, simply because you saw that somebody else was armed?

Thats nice...Care to make an argument, or are you just op-eding my viewpoints?
I thought God forbid them to eat dead cows, or was it poultry ? emoticonXRolleyes
And posts like yours serve no purpose other than to detract from the subject at hand. The subject at hand involves how some people choose to fear the law-abiding and feel safer with the law-breakers. You've done absolutely nothing to dispute these facts and prove them wrong.

Well personally I tend to always question the intelligence of someone who believes that that a cosmic Jewish Zombie who was his own 2000 year old space god father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree...
So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws).   But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal.
I'd lo9ve to test your hypothesis sometime by dropping a few Democrats into a pack of wolves and seeing who survives. emoticonXSmilie
Last time I checked most state boards merely set the guidelines, whether or not they are followed is something entirely different. Still the fact that you have a board of education spouting such ridiculousness is pretty damn amusing.
Abstinence until heterosexual marriage isn't encouraging heterosexual marriage?  I've never heard of an abstinence-until-domestic-partnership program. Perhaps you could point us to an inclusive abstinence-only program somewhere.  Perhaps not....
So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies.
I did, you rejected my evidence with your usual excuses. Now, tell me about the big bang.
Good- we were tired of you not responding or saying, "it isn't worth my time."
Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.
Only if you include the fact that while cleaning up the water he is beating the pipe with a hammer.
Oh, ok, I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better. How about I refer to them as "intelligence deficient".

And where, pray tell, does your un-'ignorant' system of proper behaviour come from?
Oh, I think they ought to creat this superstate and we Americans will REALLY have a big laugh. Go for it. I need the levity.
It was a hypothetical question that has been answered..please try to keep up.
Really?!! I'm not aware of any kids being born to two gay biological parents (unless one is a lesbian and the other a gay man, that is).  
I did not know that Obama was of low IQ and a conservative, for he is most assuredly a racism and bigot.
So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.
Do you know why gay sex sinners refuse to repent? Because they have an idol - gay sex.
Yes, it's been supressed. Only 14 people knew it before some brave soul tortured them until they confessed the horrible truth!!
No I think YOU are the imbecile. And it's great to see you follow your buddy EZ and his ways.. I suppose you've been training with him for some time now.. You're almost identical twins .. give it a bit more time and we won't be able to tell you apart.
Really, can you show me this science? You are just as genetically similiar to a white person as you are to an embryo.
How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.
gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?
Yeah, the lesbians. emoticonXRolleyes It would also mean the end of the human race. emoticonXGood
Which is why 50 million Americans are uninsured, including 9 million children. With 27,000 from that group dying every year, as a result of "freedom", and unpaid hospital bills the leading cause of bankruptcy and homelessness. Also for the other 50 million who are underinsured.
Dear Jill:  P.S. Remember, I gave you the morning after pill? Use it! Or hey make a few thousand dollars and donate it to research (cha-ching)!!  P.S.S. Thanks for the herpes! emoticonXGood And you think you have a medical problem, all you have to do is take a pill and you're done with the situation I gave you, but what about the situation you have now given me???   What's that (new) quote: All is fair in Love, sex and war? emoticonXKill   Jack
Kudos to Dubya! I thought that Brown was, well I don't know, INCOMPETENT!
And yet the species that exist today are the exact same as the species during the high oxygen content? That makes little sense. It's like saying the world was vastly different before yet perfectly suited for the species that exist today. That is COMPLETELY nonsensical.   Where did all of the oxygen go?
I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us.   (Alan Keyes, the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama. The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack. Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to "represent" NY'ers. Yeah, look who's the hypocrit now.)
That would be the fault of you rather than us. Everyone knows a small mind can't see what's beyond it's comprehension level.  
Hmmm.... your religious predecessors would have sentenced you to house arrest for something so heretical.
What case? You don't have a case, or a leg to stand on! emoticonXRolleyes
Then God should have used someone they trusted and respected to deliver that message. emoticonXRolleyes   
Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. The only ones who tend to ask "Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position.
Back in 1967, societal view of marriage was opposite-sex. Wait ... it's STILL that way. (Seen the ballot initiatives around the country?!) The point is that letting blacks marry whites didn't fundamentally redefine marriage, because it was still between a man and a woman.  
So theistic evolution is not a belief, not a faith at all? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using God to fill gaps?
Not the same thing at all! Most gay pride floats are moade of crate paper and glue guns. Not gold. I think you have stratched this one really far. Nice try, thanks for playing. Try again soon! Wow, nicotine cravings make me a mean person!
Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion.
Watch out, Jim. She believes that the only good man is a neutered man. emoticonXIc
WW, are you talking to yourself?  If not, then please learn how to attribute statements to the person who made them.
No, this is the point of the 10th amendment. Article 1 Section 8 applies to Congress...the 10th amendment grants all powers not listed to the states or people.   The 14th amendment is not the "federal government can do whatever" amendment.   
Hey, someone has to clean our toilets. This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education.
ROFLMAO! Nice way of restating the 'inaccurate' statement basically the same way.
So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?
And this coming from a so called, self proclaimed "rational christian" ? It appears you have blown your cover as a poser by showing your true colors as an anti-christian atheist and a hatemonger. Thanks for revealing your true Nature. emoticonXGood
Hollow bones however when equipped with wings allow for greater flight distance.
LOL! Aye, Lad, you're lucky that I'm not in my Berserker mood today!
Most certainly. The fact that you think that it is unnecessary only underlines your ignorance. Why don't you discuss beetle lungs for us. Those are organs necessary for the survival of both bears and cheetahs. How about livers. Same story. Thyroid? Pituitary? Pancreas? Go for it.
Your extremist views are surfacing. It's likely you'd rather follow California into the pits of wierdism.
Oh, i thought "bullet" was some sort of slang term. Never mind.
Ok genius, explain to me how come it is that I dont believe in monsters, in ghosts,in luck,the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, and so many other things that a lot of people believe in, but yet I believe in God. Do I have some deep seated delusional fantasy or something like that. You seem to be wise and all knowing( maybe all powerfull as well). Yep, im convinced you are a legend in your own mind. You believe what you will, and I will do the same, and in the end we will see who is right and who is not.
I just linked you to it. (You do understand how amendments work, yes?) Note the "to lay."  
Except that the government was tapping phones, and isn't interfering with freedom of speech. But if you ignore reality, then your parallel kinda works, I guess.
Hardy, har har! It is nice to see sinjin is still "hanging" around :)
So, Steeeeve, I take it you are not for a FAIR society?   Is an unfair society a moral society? Please explain. I find it difficult to comprehend.
Why not, after all, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy
Well, either the real or imaginary Phyllis implied those things in the post under discussion.
Well, you got that one exactly right. I didn't bother to watch your video. It was pretty predictable coming from you - personal attacks on creationists. I quoted YOU because of what YOU said.
If we did not have criminals, we wouldnt have "shoot outs" as you so call them.
Ever see someone try to kill you?that can causes paranoia also.emoticonXRolleyes
  I guess I SHOULD give you some time to mourn, so go back and dry your snot
Interestingly everyone but 'the left' can assimilate what is being said, however, the left is notorious for their ever-present attitude that everyone else is mindless. You don't got no brownie points.....
I see. So you actually reject all of science and still are willing to use a computer and the Internet. Don't you know that you are being led astray by your IBM processor?
If you can't prove or deal in absolutes, then the basis of your argument, the "absolute" nature of logic, just became pretty shaky.
How about you post all the " Great Amount" of evidence concerning the Gospel Mythology. The fact that you don't even bother to read the actual information and form an argument tells me you have nothing......
I think that might mean that you should shut your trap about other people and not pass judgement on them (i.e. Carl Sagan right here in this topic, etc.). What do you think?
But AA's not responsible for that, because he is an A-rab.
Hey Matt, if that paintbrush were any broader, you could paint a room in just five minutes
>_> one would think pulling the power, breaking into someone's house, and having raped her once and been reported would have been proof enough.   What do you want a video of him raping her or something?
You mean other than the fact that Mr. Pocketwatch and Mrs. Pocketwatch don't meet up for a night of whoopee and end up with little baby pocketwatches some time later? How about: I know that humans manufacture pocketwatches.
Kill or be killed, survival of the fittest? No compassion, the rule of tooth and fang? WOW, color me impressed!
Great job straight out of the leftard playbook. Can't refute the message so go after the messenger. Would it matter if it was printed in the NY Slimes, I doubt it.
So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.
I suppose Piltdown Man was the product of newspapers, cute indeed!
Yet another non-response. (We're not going to have to start counting these, are we?) It fails to address your dilemma of the "just are" theories.  
I've decided that I will answer this question once and for all if someone can prove to me why people need tennis racquets. If someone can answer this for me, I will attempt the definitive assault weapon response. Have at it.
So do you think that the earth is hundreds of millions of years old?
You mean you're for real? You're not setting out deliberately to make creationists look as if they don't know what they're talking about? Because that's all you're achieving.  Still no source for the trillions, I see.
I was under the impression that he was referencing the video...since he always interchanges the words embryo and fetus I just rolled with it.   Secondly, an embryo does have instructions for a brain...while a plant does not. I guess the answer hear depends on the ever evolving definition of "mental existence".
You mean you are as biologically ignorant and as easily refuted as the thread originator? Yes, we knew that already. Why all the big letters?
Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making.
Yeah yeah whatever and there are gay catholics also. The point is that the vast majority of baptists are the <term that has been banned>
You mean Priests? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them, can't get enough of that catholic loving...
You know, I've seen this BS from you quite often. Is your life sour? Do you need to make other peoples lives as miserable as you can just so you can get through the day?
how about small cute animals? whare is the line of what religion allows, and law forbids? we know it is not where harm comes to another person, or poligamy would be legal
And refusing to donate your resources is killing, so I have killed someone by not donating my blood etc.  
So, is a giant Panda a bear? Or some other "kind"?
Interesting, this is the same type of angry rants that Capo used to post on the abortion debates before he was banned. How interesting that you should get so angry and worked up over such an innocent exchange between me and chloe.  
You would say that, because you are neither a woman, nor gay. Families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist by the way, and women and children had few rights. The family structure was "secure" that way. Yes, the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage, is just such a good thing in and of itself. This meant fewer people burning in hell, which is what is really important.emoticonXRolleyes
I actually agree. Make it legal and sign away your rights. However - there are plenty of fathers who opt....... "Deadbeat Dad" is practically a profession.
A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man. And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all.
I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation.   PS...from "our" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain.
I have an avatar? And I wasn't born in 1990. Remember what the say about assumptions...
and you shouldn't forget the thousands of gays incinerated at this death camp!!!
Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it
Agreed, and the vehicle they will be riding in will be the Prosperity Express.:)
There are certainly more people who think that species evolve from earlier species than there are than people who think species evolve from later species.
You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind.
And it seems that the only thing that repulses you is religion. Curious... emoticonXRolleyes
If that's the case I wish someone would unplug me. I'm getting tired of this version of reality.
It's only obvious to the delusional ones, as I did not lift it from anyone. Just stating the truth. If it hurts, tough.
Waxy, don't you have better things to do than cruise gay threads. ;)
And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am. However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice. Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment.
Oh come on. If those words were hateful, then you need to 'investigate' probably millions of people, because those are pretty normal sentiments. Canada must have a LOT of tax dollars. I don't entirely agree with what he said either, but I think it's downright scary that your govt. investigates something like that.
What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand?
Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:  Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?  A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns.
Right, what I think doesn't make you naive or delusional, what you think does.
Oh, but it does mean something to him. He can't/won't say what, but it sure isn't based on homophobia, no siree! It's just really, really important that marriage stay a striaghts only club, for reasons that can't be explained, but there's no bigotry, don't worry on that score. emoticonXRolleyes
You mean the guy who didn't tell his own cabinat he was going to Argentina to go get a little.. and left a power gap because no one knew where he was? You mean that guy?  That is a heck of a lot worse that actually having an affair. Eliot Spitzer at least had the decency to resign when he got caught being a hypocrite.   I personally don't care about his diddling with some woman.. although it does make him a hypocrite since he ran on the 'family values' campaign. It's that little thing about leaving his duties behind without communication that is the real destruction the public trust.
Exactly my point! After four pages he finally gets it! Give him a hand! There's a brain in that head after all! But my point is, that unless you do disagree with the stats, your argument is irrelevant.   [QUOTE]What I have been saying for the last three pages is that your question is idiotic, as you're comparing things which are completely different in function. They are not analogous.  
Why is it that people don't want to admit that it was Bush's' reckless spending on a War that we didn't need , the tax cuts for the richest 2 % of America, The Fact that under Bush they had to ADD space on the Debt clock, not to mention that he was as dumb as a rock, yet they can place all this blame on Obama who inherited this mess and has done more to get us out of it than Bush or any Republican would have done. Unemployment is High, we know this, but it was on it's way up when Obama took over because under Bush more corporations left this country , more businesses closed down, the Banks were allowed to do whatever they wanted without regulation of any kind, and yet none of it is his fault?.. Enlighten me...
Somebody needs to check his Little Golden Dictionary. "Random" and "selective" are antonyms. To say that selection is random is to admit ignorance of the English language.
Yeah, lets tax those rich greedy jerks!!! I mean really, why be equal when you want something for free right??? SCREW FREEDOM I WANT MY HEALTHCARE!!!
Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics. Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number. I am sure that IRS, GOD, and Hovind can work it all out.
But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is. What it isn't is an explosion. I don't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang, have you?
He certianly is better educated about things like that than certain evangalic christians.
The question is do the dogs want to be protected ? Those poor dogs, for all you know they might prefer death.
Two answers: they were either of the ant kind and didn't eat wood until they underwent hyperevolution after the landing of the ark, or they were placed in a suspended state of hibernation by 'Awlmighty Gawd' (only two - one male and one female, in spite of the fact that termites don't actually propagate that way). It is, after all, the word of Gawd, as revealed in the wholly babble.
I did not say that I thought that, that would be putting words in my mouth. Sure they'd have access to the report... Sneddon probably had his grubby hands on it ASAP. So what if the investigation was done by private investigators? If Sneddon did it, he would plant evidence... he probably did that when they searched MJ's house. Oops I mean... the government NEVER lies. emoticonXWow
Can you say "OVER GENERALIZATION"? Can you say "UNJUST STEREOTYPING"? Can you say "LIES"? Can you say "MISINFORMATION"? Can you say "MUDDYING THE WATERS? Can you say "JAAAMAN"?

Damn, takes some real gonads (wait, you're a Lib, so scratch THAT one) to claim the power to get inside the minds and hearts of the masses...a protest by Conservatives MUST be racist, but a protest by Libs is pure and righteous, correct?
if you can find an impartial judge, i'll take you up.
No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is.
My house evolved over millions of years. it built itself . Prove me wrong. emoticonXRolleyes
Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact.
Because the gay personals are full of married straight men looking for discrete gay sex
So, do you spend all of your days as an Obama shill? You have two posts, both anti-McCain. I hope Obama pays well. emoticonXRolleyes
Yes. So you are indeed committing the genetic fallacy. And apparently unaware of the semantic ambiguity of the sixth commandment. Thanks for clarifying.

On the other hand abortion is only opposed by the born and wars are started only bu the born and choices are made etc etc etc etc.
Which is why the "medical establishment" endorses smoking, drinking heavily and a fatty diet, with no excercise, because they believe we are predestined by our genes, right? Why do you persist with these blatant lies?
Your "opinion" was a kindergarten question outlining a "problem" that never existed, a "problem" that was explained to you 3 or 4 times. How is it our fault that you ask such embarassing questions repeatedly, despite having the answers explained to you repeatedly? How does this reflect poorly on anyone but you?
But yet you have the right to make an an a-s-s out of yourself? As far as the nude beaches go, it would be worth the plane fare if I knew you were going to be at one so I could laugh my a-s-s off.   FROTFLMAO  
You said there wasn't a pro-choice group before Roe v Wade. However I would have to do my research to dig up a group in 1850. Hold on...
I dunno. Those Priuses are so small inside and out. How much explosive compound could Hasan fit into the thing and still be able to get in and drive it?
Well, you certainly defended this video, Archangel. How interesting to now hear that you were defending material you hadn't even viewed.   But I'm not going to do your homework for you. It's on this thread; jyoshu posted it. So search his posts on these pages.  
And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....
This is begging so many darn quesions it's boggling my mind!
Quite True. I guess those are pretty useless. I suppose His Noodly Appendage works in mysterious ways.

Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so "self-confident" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.
Cheerio and thanks for the examples! Yes these are perfect examples of animals creating "unnatural" things- I happen to be thinking of Beavers and their dams but hey, thats just me.
Considering what you turkeys did to the State of California, with its budget and social depravity, you have no room to talk. I'm surprised the Lord hasn't cast San Francisco and L.A. into the Pacific Ocean yet.

Nothing anyone has said has proven anything I have said wrong in any way because all you have are unprovable and unproven assumptions. Now go over to the other debate Creation versus evolution like a good little boy and you will get my response to Tiktaalik. Nkaaaay?
Ah! So wellspoken for an addle-pated twiddle poop! I congratulate you!  And a total lie! Who the Hades wants 13-year-old children to be sexually active? No responsible, thinking person could wish such a thing. You malign Planned Parenthood.  You have ceased to be a credible commentator on this issue.
I note the bolding but the reason for it is as inscrutable as the peculiar form of what appears to be English which is used.

For one to have evolution as their foundation belief, means that one cannot be certian of anything.....
In other words you would wait until we were attacked again before doing what is required. If we vacillate and wait for the nuclear cloud it will be too late. It amazes me; utterly amazes me, at how strongly felt the left believes in the good will of bin Laden and the terrorists to clean up their act. Just amazing. But with Bush? Noooooooo. He's ALWAYS wrong and never right. Isn't that about it?
Yes, but an adult asking such a question is not capable of understanding the answer. ;)
Please be sure to give that message to all the criminals out there. We wouldn't like to have the situation where all the law abiding citizens got rid of their guns and the criminals kept them, would we?
The Archbishop of York has a screw loose too on that subject.

You do realize you just disproved your own basic points yes?   The pictures you posted are falsified because abortion clinics and small health clinics contract out to places to have their medical waste incinerated.   Good job on failing to realize you just proved Cunx correct.

Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. Quick search reveals NO mentions at all. Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical.

Oh you do love to do the psychological technique known as 'transference' don't you...or is it 'projection'???   You are so obsessed with gay sex, I would not be surprised if you and Ted Haggard have a lot to talk about.

About a third of the weapons seized in Mexico were referred to the U.S. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   About half were successfully traced. Better than 90% of those to U.S. dealers.   Of course your definition of "minute" might differ from mine.
No, they don't. Creationists do. "Why haven't all animals turned into humans?"
Right. I'm damaged because I'm not a Christian wing-nut. I'm still looking for at least some refutation.
You your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that? I suspect that you are talking out of your elbow since I haven't seen any evidence that you know what logic is. Mostly I see hysteria and superstition in your posts.
Flip back to page 9 and do try to keep up.   I am not going to spam the board for the weakest link.
On the evidence, that must have been where his brain was located.
Do try to keep up with yourself. People like you are always talking about how we need gun control laws in response to the crimes taking place. But you have absolutely no answer for what to do when said laws are violated.
You are just playing dumb, right? There will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment PER INSURED. Their pay will not be cut. There will be fewer of them PER INSURED. Initially the absolute volume will increase.
How remarkable. What a singular idea to invent a contest of skill in which a person in opposition tries to prevent one from outperforming them. Is this the only type of game in which there are two sides, or is this a novelty?

You know I actually considered that. Too much work, though. I have added to my list of things to do when I retire. That is, of course, assuming that we turned things around by then. If not, I will likely be too busy "holding the fort" against the hordes of starving yuppies.
So it's alright for a Evo to insult you and go off on a tangent, and expect to get answer. What's the point in answering if your being mocked, before you give answer. Now I know why there are few Creo's on this forum.
Even Joe the plumber abandoned the garbage scow? Say it aint so!
Winning any political election has never been about electing the "best" man for the office, it simply means you appeal to the majority of people that showed up to vote. Smartest and most popular aren't necessarily the same person, if you went to school you probably remember that. ;)
VoR is about as Catholic as the Archbishop of Cantebury. I'm curious about what I'm right about though, seeing as I asked you whether you think that medically un-necessary abortions should be legal or not.
I though the torture was just a result of the number of wing nuts there were around the place.
And you can be described as a "pre-dead corpse" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???
Oh, I agree....private security companies are the answer. Very republican of you.
So, faith and argument from incredulity.   If you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. Then maybe an actual scientist could take over.  Major in molecular biology? Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.
Ah yes, the Might Makes Right principle. Mob rule. You are so fond of it I have to assume that you assume the mob is always going to agree with you. Poor, naive soul...
First off, your sick. To actually want to see more death and destruction.  Are Americans somehow less intelligent? Your notions are racist for lack of a better term. What to meet stupid? Walk out your front door and sample the people on the side walk. You'll find the same stupid around the world.
Even then, your statement does nothing. They aren't "getting themselves pregnant". A doctor is doing a medical procedure, that may or may not result in a pregnancy (ya know, those little sperm thingies?) emoticonXAngel

So then the handgun ban did absolutely nothing. Nice to see you could finally admit the truth.

No, no, no. If humans were created 4,000 years ago, then the earth was created 4,000 years and a few days ago. At least try and get it right.
You don't see protesters walking around going "I wanna marry my dog" or "beastiality rocks" do you?!
What part did your real daddy play in it? Will he be on the island, too?  This is a good example of a scant level of maturity. Your simple out for various arguments is to play the idiot/XXXXX card.  More and more each day I see you as a complete waste of oxygen.
Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.
And, let's see, when did the job loss actually start?   Oh yes.. We can trace the troubles starting in 2007, with a big melt down in August/September of 2008. Let's see.. Obama must have been a terrible president to have caused that.. oh WAIT. That wasn't Obama, that was BUSH.. Excuse Me.
You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.
So Simone, if the shooter had instead driven his Toyota Prius into a crowd, killing many as a result, would you call for banning Toyota Priuses?
Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.
Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be.   These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone.

I must agree with Sarge about the homophone,could that be why Mr.Obama appears to stand tall from your view?emoticonXCensored
That's what's known around here as a lie, and I wish you were capable of feeling ashamed of yourself.
I'm sure the response is that He could. But, y'know, God's a real XXX sometimes... (Besides, who do you think used His uber-complex biochemical engineering skills to create the prions responsible for FFI, anyway?)
Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage. So by all means don't marry a man and the problem is solved.
Thanks, for giving me the balls. I didn't know you were trying to convert me. So, because I don't believe what you want me to I'm retarded. You know I could say the same about you, it works both ways. You see I don't want to convert you, all I'd like to see is you open your mind to other possibilities. Adios, Arrevideci
Very Interesting! After only 33 posts Mintaka already has the political and gun advocacy priorities of individual members here down pat; or should I say the resurrected antonia, our resident National socialist healthcare freak does and couldn't help but expose her personal insights where none should exist for this alleged newbie.
So you're claiming the beardy bloke nailed to a couple of bits of 2X4 didn't actually exist?emoticonXRolleyes
And have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my "soul mate." Yeah. I'm thinking if they're willing to make me go through that they're not a soul mate at all. >_>
oh ok, so I assume you don't live in your own house? I was trying to picture over 61 people fitting into one house. :)

I'd be curious if Berkowitz studied whether a sword or club produced the same effect as a firearm?   Short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty, I'm afraid boys will be boys.
We have a terrorist supporter among us, objecting to restrictions on terrorists! Why do you hate America?
And ill continue to have pity for abused and unplanned pregnant women lacking basic healthcare.
Doesn't surprise me lets all jump ship and put our heads in the sand... Even more of a reason I should run for public office :p  
Sounds like a movie... We could threaten to use our old nukes on all the potential enemies...oh, yeah, we've already done that.
Well if no siege comes, I guess no harm no foul.
You're the one who needs to get a grip. Lots could get worse, but not for the reasons you're stating.   But I take it you're finally admitting that (actually) 50 million uninsured human beings who could die or go bankrupt is a big problem.
There you are NATO, you have justified a Final Solution for the "Mexican problem". Let me quote you   
Did the bill include burning heretics at the stake, stoning them out of the village or removing a women's right to vote?
Here is a mind blower. Maybe they are celebate because being married to Jesus they are saving themselves for sex with him.
Then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? Silly, I 'd say! Humans are part of the animal kingdom. Mammals if I remember from biology. Are you not an animal? If not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon.
Really? Well, when I have a kid, I'll be sure to just leave it in the woods, since it can apparently care for itself.
It's Satan, not Satin. And he's your daddy, not ours (John 8:44).
No, you shot off a smart remark while failing to address any of the issues. Par fro the course for you. It seems like maybe you would be more comfortable on a blogging page than a forum page, especially a blogging page without a space for reader responses.
ah but freedom of speech has many limitations. Since liberals are opposed to American principles their speech can be considered treasonous. No country can survive if it allows itself to be undermined. Lincoln went all out to preserve the country, we should do the same things by making liberals illegal.  
Kinda like, "Don't speak of the speck in your brothers eye when you have a plank in your own?" :p :p   The scary part of this insane reality is that there are a LOT of whackos that think just like and actually support Pat Robertson. And I would venture to say that 98% of them who voted, voted for Bush. Ha! There's one born every minute.   Perhaps this might clue some folks in, as to the concerns the folks have on the left, as to the direction this nation is headed? Or, then again, maybe not. emoticonXRolleyes
Oh, Mrwriterman made a funny. I guess not all gays are humorless. :)   
Public policy? Takes waaaay too much thought. Now one can go to ballpark here and pay $8.50 for a half pound hot dog, smothered in thick layers of chili, cheese and grilled onions (2,200 calories, 55 grams of saturated fat, 1,600 milligrams of sodium). That's a no-brainer (literally).  Dono
Balderdash! Atheism isn't science. That's nonsense. And science is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is.  
OMG SO TRUE!!! Two of my friends chose to be asian, my mom chose to be a woman, and my PE teacher chose to be black. OMGZZ@! YOURE SO RIGHT!!!
Yeah.. caught that... But, hey.. I think you made a mistake.
Hmm maybe I should take that one to a local patent office...
Funny how people who are "for" capital punishment don't see it that way...
First of all a man cannot terminate tissue he isn't carrying.The father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is.
Oh yes yes... never mind the thousands of lives destroyed, the shame, the guilt, the anger, the fear and all the while perhaps being in a combat zone and having that stress...  Never mind the hundreds of millions wasted retraining new people because we kicked out perfectly able people because of their sexuality...   All you can do is sit here and spew non threatening bunk to try and scare people and make your bigotry somewhat tangible to your warped mind...
Can't you come up with your own line? I really did not think you would see the bucket of worms that would be stirred up if gay marriage was lawful but I tried to give you my best shot.............I did not even mention the income tax implications if this was allowed............
How about the pass that the Clintonistas routinely gave to Bubba for his Oval Orifice tryst with Monica??   
Yes but of course was that rreally a consious choice? I see sarcasm but no real answer that is credible.......seesh if I wanted srcasm I would have watched the Orielly factor. (oh wait thats yelling and bicering) knida like politics! (oops sarcasm hehe)
ROTFLMAO. The guy is more like Bush than I realized.   Come on, Easy, if you have never tried pot or XXXX, you are in the minority.   Nobody cares.
with tens of millions of gun owners, and hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and you think the guns are still the problem....
Unriggable, your statement should read the so-called "pro-life" since they are anything but.
And that's why I think you are a troll. There really aren't any experts here. There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind.
Perfect. A creationists caught repeating the same refuted arguments on different forums. Resistance is met, run like a coward to another forum.
Methinks it's rather obvious that mintaka is JimIrvine because no rational newbie would come here and agree with Irvine's ridiculous and juvenile attacks/assertions out of the box. emoticonXRolleyes
A woman's right to choose to keep her legs together is not in any way abridged by this bill. Ho, ho,f***ing ho.
how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport.
Plenty of examples,law abiding citizens are shot by criminals daily.However the O.P. is about police going off the edge.Oh did I mention that some of those law abiding citizens sometimes shoot the criminal trying to kill them?
Is this another attempt of yours to paint all that believe in smaller, less-intrusive government as loonies? Very transparent, sorry. :(
Society highly values the creation of future taxpayers, especially under deficit-spending socialist presidents. :p
You're deluded, as usual. Anything that doesn't balance the budget is based on LIBERAL THINKING. And you don't balance the budget with massive tax hikes and gutting the military like the liberals are fond of doing. And you're going to vote for liberals? Obama? His latest budget plan was defeated 414-0 in the House. Not even his liberal cohorts would vote for it. And you vote for Obama? What the hell is the matter with you people?
Not nearly as tired as the "YOU can't live like that because it is against MY religion" argument. Hell, that one pre-dates Christianity!
And yet we're still waiting for your mental condition to finally hit you like a ton of bricks.... Denial is the usual reaction...
You put such confidence in articles written by partisan plebes, using unsupported, irrelevant links to make the printed text pseudo-intelligent. I cannot imagine you holding your own in a serious debate.
Tell us, Steve, now you've been thoroughly snowed (again) by the GOP, how's the weather up there in CloudCuckooLand?
You can believe what you want, your beliefs are not relevant to the issue.
...but you are just fine with marijuana smoke huh?  I am working on the assumption that you run home to tell mommie or you run to find your teacher and report it immediately. Midgets like you got to have some backup.  How and why do you always change the subject? Can't take the heat? Do you ever read headers?  You got a mouth on you as big as grand canyon.
I can neither confirm nor deny at this particular juncture that I may or may not be either male or female. :)  
Apparently in Marc9000's small, small, small world, if you're not a Christian, you're a atheist.   Thus over 4 billion people are atheists. emoticonXAgree
This is great. You mean none of the Davidic line ever copulated with women to produce their descendents? LOL!  
You will soon learn, my friend, that fundies have very, very short memories when it comes to refutations of their arguments...

That's the difference between liberals and conservatives (AKA "real Americans.) Conservatives have a sense of humor. Liberals don't.
Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.
I thought that the most commonly accepted date for the alleged birth of Jesus was in 4 B.C. Assuming the current calendar really were keyed on the birth of Christ, how could Christ have been born Before Christ?
You mean your hypothetical I presume? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal.   You're a bit slow I see.
  How does this address your claim that the Second Amendment served as a defense against a tyrannical federal government? Are you moving the goalposts now?  
Of course God would have something to offer to lowely peon, but that doesn't explain what use God has for lowely peons, except for doing stupid pet tricks.
You and your spiritually-challenged friends are obviously too stupid to understand the difference between a cult and Biblical Christianity.

Anyone who can read the entire page will find that Zeus is in there, but since you apparently can't read I forgive your ignorance.. emoticonXByeemoticonXBye
Like the crusades and the inquisition? How about the Southern Baptist Convention, formed at the end of the Civil War with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks? And of course, the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you. Of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't. But when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so I just never turn my back on them. That way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, I will at least have my eye on my money.
Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it.
And this differs from your cell how? (oh wait it doesn't).  
Well, you did... only that "you" then resided in countries like France, Brittain, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Ireland, Botswana, China etc, etc ;).... And yes, we where all racists back then...
I typically don't read Antonia's propaganda pieces, so is she holding up the UK as a shining example of dental health? If so, I suggest that she ask a typical Brit to smile, so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion. The US' "bubbas" have better teeth than the average Brit. emoticonXRolleyes
You are like, so totally noble and sensitive! I really admire your pro-humanity stance. That is going out on limb.
Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.
LoL What part of a Binding Document, the Constitution with it's Bill of Rights, don't you understand!   You demand that we obey the law, but you would allow Government to break the Supreme law of the Land, and you call me a nut? I gotta say my friend, THAT is truly nutty! emoticonXSmilie
Maybe I wanted it from a source that was worth looking at
That's nice, but have you ever thought of reading your own religion's Holy Book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that Jesus and his disciples said?  
Actually no. You read the article again, and thoroughly this time.

Do you have something-other then words from a dusty old book of myth to offer as an explanation?
A gay person is a homosexual, friend. He can't change that part about himself. He was wired that way. If you don't like the idea of gay sex, then I'd suggest you not participate in gay sex. That's pretty simple. If you don't want gay marriage, then don't get one.
Well if it's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades? And while you're at it, supply the names of the companies who're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions.
Well, the French have always been an independent and rebellious lot, not like those staid northern Europeans. And let's remember how much we all owe to those heathens of Greece and Rome!

My article say's this. it needs to be noted the alleged evidence for extensive history assumes uniformitarian geology. Because of this fact, this response adds up to: Your theory doesn't work under my theory, so your theory is wrong. Of course you don't want to consider that fact, do you?

Why would anyone want to get to Heaven? Archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . Thanks but no thanks!
So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage.
Just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.

It doesn't take a Ph.d. to understand who wrote the first Gospel. Grade school children can look up who was the first man to walk on the moon.

By your own admission you haven't 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?

I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?
This is odd. You voluntarily participate in a Religion discussion forum - indeed, the frequency of your posting suggests that this participation occupies a substantial portion of your leisure time - but when someone presents you with the opportunity to demonstrate the validity of your position, you 'have better things to do'.
And so goes the fact you're more than willing to let rapists and murderers go free.
Here in Michigan, they closed down the first rest area on I-75 because of the high amount of gay encounters taking place there. Maybe you should poke your head out of your closet once in a while and see what the rest of your community is up to.   
Other than the Soldini firearms were purchased legally there is no proof that he had a concealed carry permit. If he had the AP and the rest of the left-tard media (redundancy alert) would still be shouting it from the roof tops. Just because the Brady bunch-VPC says so doesn't make it true. Then what else can we expect from a self confessed torturer of helpless small animals and arsonist?

Somehow I seriously doubt that "Testimonium Flavianum itself" meant "from the website by Peter Kirby entitled 'Testimonium Flavianum' that happens to have the text of Josephus' An 20.9.1." But if that's what you're going with, whatever.   
And it remains to be seen if your are. Pick an unreasonable and dumb argument go with it.

Don't you have that other weird warped forum your posting in now?! Go there with your advice.
Hey Dane, you're real good at calling people ignorant, sanctimoniously declaring everything they say as false, blatantly false, or falsehoods. But would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts arguments with anything more than insults? Like some actual facts for example?
Then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. He was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. It was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. He made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. Bush doesn't send kids to Iraq. First of all they volunteer. Second of all, they are older than 18. Please let me know what comments Michael Moore made that you thought were worthy. You might have trouble.  
Yea I guess you're right, you people tend to blur together after a time.
The first Christians were Jews. Anyone who claims to be a Christian but hates Jews is a XXXXX. An anti-Semetic Christian is like an oxymoron term. And an Aryan is supposed to be someone with blue-eyes, brown-hair, and light-skin. You don't have to believe in 'Aryanism' to be Aryan, and the mortal enemies of Aryans are not Jews. 'Aryans' may hate Jews, but most Jews aren't bigoted. By the way, Hitler did not like just Jews but others he considered 'inferior' to the 'superior' 'Aryan race.'   Do some actual research instead of pulling XXXX out of the air to conform to your screwed up opinions.

So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.

A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong, so you must mean rape is good? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong, so you must mean sexual immorality is good?
No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off.
The gentleman (??) in question has been presented the facts numerous times. He "pooh-pooh"s them as irrelevant. He places himself above scientific research. He doesn't know the difference between unsolicitated testimonials and scientific evidence.
What difference does it make? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents? If so doesn't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas?
Very impressive how you argue science. Are your arguments science, or are they anger? When Dawkins argues it with his above statement, that Darwinism is as all-encompassing as God is stated to be in the Bible, is it really science, or is it religion?
And once again (s)he rambles on while responding to nothing said in the prior post. At least you're consistent in your irrational hate speech. BTW, the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all. Except in the mind of paranoid hate mongers, that is. emoticonXGood
Man, you are really enriching this debate. We should all sit and listen to your wisdom.
Yea, at least on earth you get some relief, you die eventually.
Whatever. First you say no one is calling you a hypocrite, than you say people do it, but it just an attack tactic.

However, we do give people alcohol, there are many people who drink it on a regular basis who are not addicts. What do these substances you mention have to do with being gay? Would it perhaps be okay for me to have homosexuality on the weekends or after work during happy hour?  
It's as much of a point that Phillp Johnson has. Trying to use Philip Johnson as a source about evolution is like trying to use Jack Chick as a source about Catholism.
Well, it's not as though you hold your tongue all that often when it serves in support of an anti-gay argument.  
And creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false.
Except, of course, the evidence is totally against that. Plus, there is the little matter of infant mortality... and lack of resources.   But hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you.
And if there's one thing I can count on, it's your insistence that we can assume guilt and should make a public spectacle of the matter before even investigating any matter.   
If you need a decision made for you, ask me. I'll be glad to. Be prepared to raise your child though.

How do you know if they WANT to believe in a deity? They simply don't.
Man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form. Did we invent the wheel, or discover the idea? Did the Wright brothers invent machine powered flight, or was it that they stumbled upon it? In every culture, in every society, man looks to something greater than himself.

So what? How long did the idea of magical creation out of nothing in 6 days hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically?
No - but they certainly have a bias. As do we all.

To bad you don't have the power to define the situation.
well if I don't get an answer here I'll just spread it around the whole internet. Fine with me.
Are you blind? I was refering to Nancy Pelosi's "'fair' speech" policies, not free speech. Fair speech is an attempt to limit free speech.
To the exclusion of all others? I thought you were working for acceptance and inclusion. You are the only one allowed to "exclude?"   
Ever hear of artificial ensemination? Why is that heteros only think there is one way to produce children? I find hetero sex disturbing,and an unnatural lifestyle choice.
Yes none of the organs flown in from Africa or India would be farmed from murdered people, would they?  
Well I suppose I could've always put up a sign that said "Trespassers will be held with legal counsel, robbers will be shot, survivors will be shot again" but you're just welcoming trouble with that.
Are you jealous because they won't let you out of the institution while gansao get's to run all over the place?
No, it's one of those rare instances in which YOU are on the right side of an issue. :p;)
And the ability to digest nylon is not a new function?? You seem to have a different conception of 'new function' that what matches with reality.
My mistake; I read it wrong. And guess what? I do know what the moon is ;)
Am I suppose to take that as an insult or just a passing remark,hmmm?
I know. Sad indeed. Orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas. As if Jesus (who is God according to Scripture) would come out and give Moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man. Get real. When the antichrist comes he'll probably be gay (one OT scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women, and Satan loves to mimic God's kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist.). Then Orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior.
I suspect a good many monitors and keyboards got cleaned on that one? ;)
And woman's law superceeds both, or hasn't your mummy taught you that little lesson yet Hunted?
Most congregations are expecting to leave the U.C.C.? Where did you see this, or are you making up the news again?
Does this mean that you have finally repented of your multiple divorces??
Mr. Brown was able to attend ball games. Not exactly held captive was he?
Cannot be helped. You make it far too easy. But do not think of yourself as a loser, think of yourself as a student with significant learning deficets.
We accept your forfiet. Two more to go! Once they post, this thread will be pretty much closed. I predict Penfold will go first, followed by Jo. emoticonXSmilie
by this stupidity a KKK mob with guns is a militia!
Did you start the thread in the hope that no one would respond to it ? Is responding to and pointing out the trolling and hypocrisy you have shown wrong ? But I congratulate you for finally admitting that this is a trolls thread. That is more than I expected from you. And as for me reinforcing your contention about conditional christian love ? I do love you my friend, I just hate what you represent which is why I express my love by correcting you and calling you on your every hypocritical contradiction. emoticonXAngel I am Archangel after all. emoticonXGood
Sigma, I was only joking. It hit me this morning though that if I'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God, I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up "women's rights". ;-)
well that won't help you when you go to hell...Woo hoo
The judge should be informed that 'the leading' IDist admits that ID is religion. (yes, I've posted this before...) What else could an unembodied designer, which naturalism perforce excludes, be but a deity? So Dembski's ID has one or more unspecified deities - supernatural, unembodied designers - creating biological systems, at some unknown time, at some unknown place, by some unknown series of steps. What a great scientific theory! :-)
Ahh, pointy tailed devils with pitchforks, more of your menagerie of divvels, demons, saints, angels, demigods, ghosts and other varied superstitious nonsense. Which of your gods created them, Snerdley?
And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing. Science should teach currently held theory.
We gotta GET them law-abiders for having the audacity to believe the Constitution's Bill of Rights! Huh Brady!
Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?
Thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like KFC to me.
You mean my dog 'CIgarette'??  I took him out for a drag.
So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?
Yeah, renaissance right back to the dark ages, that is what you a holes did the last time you were in charge.
But the official IUPAC name for acetylsalicylic acid is 2-acetyloxybenzoic acid. Duh.
You mean the malcontents bred? Oh Noes! Who are the "we" who get to do it back, and whose army will you borrow to do it with? the present bunch of obese felons are already struggling to cope with their present duties.
I don't recall seeing anyone who's for gay marriage come out truly in favor of the idea here that I recall. Can you? Naw, didn't think so. emoticonXSmilie
Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.  
Well, she IS getting her info outta the bible, one of the bloodiest snuff novels ever written lol...
You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?
Actually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in "evolutin" [sic]. The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested. It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate. It is based on evidence and not faith.
That's quite a leap, even for you. How did you know that the officiers were pro-life? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance.   I certainly think it was excessive. I guess I must not be pro-life by your illogic.
More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country.
So how is the oil and gas agreement with China working out for you antipodeans?
The CIA seems to agree with me. Appears to me that you tinfoil hat is starting to fray about the edges.
So AIDS is the fault of "the gays"?emoticonXRolleyes   lol it's been a long time, JP.
And you're a poor replacement for that koolaid-drinking Seer Travis.
and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES.
Why? Would you rather get stabbed to death for twenty minutes than get hit in the head with a bullet? A desire to have suffering extended - hmmmm...
Being' immune' and being 'less prone' do not mean the same thing.  I doubt that you will become the poet laureate of Dallas if you do not understand words sweetplums.  You are an old camp fruit and a snivelling bigot .  Are we talking daddies? What does an old fruit like you know of daddies?  I bet he's sure proud of you.emoticonXChicken  I wouldnt be proud of having a mincing bigot for a son..must have set his sights low.  Do white men still leave a bad taste in your boyfriends mouth sweetplums?  You are not married ..
Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.
Even if winnie the poo could read he simply doesn't have the brain power to comprehend.
Yeah, ok, keep up with your "Creationist" therory and I'll stick to my much more believable idea of "Evolution." Keep your religion out of MY Government!
Good one, Truthsayer emoticonXGood   ...a rich white woman... LOL! Gotta be from Texas. :p
They are the people who dont get their boilers serviced regularly:)
ok, fine, you can use that line, but there is also a moajority that believes in other things. there's this crazy thing, called a choice. we all have that. remember? i made the choice to have sex, you're making the choice to be a total ***hole. we all make a decision, and its the strong ones that stick with them, even though there are others who dont believe the same thing.
I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state.
Just another bogus reason for having and abortion............There are thousands of them.........
Whatever. emoticonXRolleyes I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here, but that's up to you.
Right, because besides rape and health concerns these really are the only other reasons women have abortions. emoticonXRolleyes
Superglue! How you gonna make the DNA?  This is all facinating but it doesn't have a thing to do with information theory.  Copying DnA to do reasearch is a neat trick and quite useful.  Is there a point to this?
And Sotomayor argued that the American people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. What's your point?
thats true. i helped. my next bible will be 10 times better if i get around to finishing it
Oh, really?   Translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to.
Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea! A lot of their mythology isn't original: it was stolen from other people who thought it up first.
What a relief, I would hate to think Batman was so gullible. But Dems, I can understand them thinking that. emoticonXHoho
And if the majority supported banning Christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? Civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.
Anyone can "give consent". The issue is wether the parson is old enough to make that decission. I bet the children Michael Jackson raped gave their consent. Does that make it "allright"? Are the kids "mature enough" to take the consequences of those actions?
So then I guess you could also debate that algebra serves no purpose as well.
Enlighten me. What evidence came out Monday, Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of this week?
Go ahead and toss your Bible in the trash so you can justify your gay sex sin. See if that gets you into heaven.
perhaps you would like to explain simplistic.  Is the anthropic principle simplistic?  What natural law created natural law?  Where did the information come from?  Is matter creating matter simplistic? Matter creating information?  Here;s a deep thought:  If matter created the Universe what if it changes it's mind! emoticonXRolleyes
You mean you don't think you have your own made-up religion?? How interesting! Do you really think you're fooling God? Or us?? Or even yourself??
Wow, you are high on Christ...Scary...I haven't seen this addiction up close emoticonXRolleyes
Well I guess then it's open season to call all anti's "CHRISTONAZI"
Wow, what a group of rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error. I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are. That's why the bible say's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God.
Now, that logic is so bad, it's worse than circular reasoning. It's figure eight reasoning.
And it will, I guess, take an amendment to deny rights to and make a whole segment of the population second class citizens.
Since he's commented on it several times now, and seems to have me confused with someone else, maybe he's channeling a past life or something--who knows? Better yet, who cares? :p
Really? What book is that, because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page. So once again accipiter, what in the world are you referring to? You and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with.   Here's my original post again, I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs, from skeletal remains?
If they haven't been discovered yet, HOW THE BLOODY HELL DO YOU KNOW?  Ten percent more brains and you'd be pondlife. emoticonXKill
whooooosh. emoticonXBye  That was the sound of my point as it went over your head.  How much do you want to but I don't find any?  Go ahead bet me! Are you afraid?
Well that's a stupid statement. Stupid enough that I can't even wrap my head around it and make a proper comparison.
Oh, but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant.
Somewhere in the middle? I always though it was solidly to the Right. :p   
An immaculately presented response, entirely avoiding the topic, or indeed reason, in order to unwittingly further the case for retrospective abortion.
Explain that one to the thread starter. He claims he is the victim of age discrimination when he states "I am a person 15 years of age and I want my gun, yet I can't get one. Why not?"
And how do you know what other animals can analyze? Is that another supreme abilities of us humans? To read the minds of animals?
Depends on how basic they are. Not much call for using flint, steel and tinder to start fires.
Dont mind him, hes just sticking up for his new boyfriendemoticonXLove
And I'm sure you of all people know the mind of God... Please, you just take snippets of scripture, and twist it into well this is absolute. God loves gays and lesbians, but you fling god out as a way to justify your slander and bigotry.   
Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers).
I dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  Once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  We are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but I am sure the preacher would condemn that too  If you read the link you would know.  If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  You really should try to use your little head more.  'Lets stay on topic' who made you a mod?emoticonXChicken
There are somewhere between 10 and 20 million gay people is America. 10,000 is a small minority, yes. And even your article admits this number is unsubstantiated, AA. More lying for JESUS.
Yes, because Republicans are the only hypocrites in the government, right? emoticonXRolleyes
Here we go again with the name calling..............See what I mean Justine.......no wonder the gay movement is losing traction in this country........
Anything that doesn't fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong?
Considering what the TOE says, if a dolphin ever gave birth to a chipmunk, it would disprove evolution.
So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders.
You're a Bush-man, aren't you, gnojek? Come on, admit it. With that stance, you'll be in the White House before sunrise.  (You do realize that I was being sarcastic - right?) emoticonXRolleyes
Yes, that was one of Galileo's more absurd leaps of logic.
Yeah, so if on my math test, I put "The answer is 7 because my god says so" and the teacher marks it wrong, he's the XXXXX?
Let's allow same-sex marriage only. Then heterosexuals will have the same right to marry someone of the same sex.

Good point. If she is old enough to be licenced to drive, presumably. If she travels by bus, train or plane, are those companies complicit?
Your own source said the amendments are 11-27. Amazing how the 2A got incorporated into the XIV isn't it without Article V. emoticonXGood
That could also be very effective in a positive manner during political campaign speeches.
You really think so? Im flattered, but I think you are wrong.
Umm I dunno that whole faith thing is kind of important. Oh I get it you were being insulting.... Gotcha.... BTW hows that whole spiritual enlightenment thing working out for you?  
Good point. emoticonXAgreeemoticonXAgree The poor guy would be like a midget that got his stepladder taken from him!
You apparently know as much about law as you do about science. You wouldn't be arrested for having someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant was a controlled substance and last time I checked, poppy and weed weren't cancer cures.
Says the one who uses the abortion card when he's about to lose a death penalty thread.   
the same way most people on planet earth dont give a XXXX about american "football"  
I get the feeling they have filed under: Plague, Avoid like the.
Translation: Muslims are worth nothing. Christianity is superior, therefore they are worth nothing. Let the US come in and kill them, ruin their cities, and take their oil.
Right, expect when talking about the 14th amendment. The way you guys like to define "equal protection" would make it so any restriction is unequal.
Here come the Christians, thinking they can know everything by guessing, and commiting the genetic fallacy left and right.
So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others, should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not?
I don't think it's a cover-up. I think that it's a conspiracy between the black helicopters and the aliens beaming suggestions to those without the foil-lined hats on. :)

In that case a man in a coma is not a person then, is he?

Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.  Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans? Naw, I don't think I should. They're just poor people and they probably didn't vote for me.
Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure.
And yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children...
Does your use of the past tense "was" imply that you've seen a burning bush and been converted to reality? Or are you still an "anti-american pinko commie bleeding heart liberal?"
You have no Idea how glad I was that I was sitting down when I read this!!  First it shocks me that you haven't labeled all those who claim to see UFO's liberals.  Then I have to wonder didn't at one time the RCC say we were the center of the universe,... The sun went around the earth,... the earth was flat ?? Theres no one but us .. It was all created for us??  Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something. I think I'm going to be sick!! Back in a few.
Simone, read the sentence again please. It was "Saving lives is "not just" a Republican goal." It concerns the subject of abortion.   The only way it relates to the politics of Iraq, is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to "volunteer" their services for Iraq.   I can't let one statement you made go though. Terrorist continue to terrorize us? Where have they attacked in the U.S. since 9-11? Consider continuing this in an appropriate thread.
Thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms, neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions. Now as I gaze at the night sky with all its' bits and pieces spinning around each other I can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall.

And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.
Like evolution, right? You have your conclusion, so everything else must adhere to it. Just answer the question. How to you account for the statements above?
Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.
Nah, he has been TRAINED to recognize demonic possession as part of his B.A.
I think jyoshu has posted a BS meter which is pretty nice.

I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too.  
Don't forget cheaper to feed, take orders better, and are harder to hit.
Wow, so Balrogs existed according to the Bible? Whoda thunk.
Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.
You bet. Got a Scriptural problem with that, 'O "jesus"? Or are you not familiar with your own inspired Word?
I guess the Sinagua ruins and the Kayenta, Anasazi Wukoki ruins in Arizona just don't stack up against them big old Jewish buildings.
Oh it applies, but if we were to look at the Bible that way, God wouldn't allow one single bad thing to happen.
That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.
Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases.
because you wanna be wrong all the time...that seems like a good reason :)
Because of massive cultural differences. You might as well be asking "if both Americans and British people speak basic english, why do British people refer to apartments as flats?"
Possibly, I must admit I never tried to gain access to swords whilst over there.
Isn't that exactly what I said! Clearly we have an issue of a probably overweight white man who is without a doubt racist (because if we know anything it is that every white male that has short hair is a racist) coming down on a black woman!   You nailed it again MA! Props to you for uncovering this mystery.
I know I know. Unless a woman is gestating or dieing she is being selfish.
Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't "really" a christian.
Gee, I wonder why the liberal left is so quiet? I remember when Bush's DWI from decades previously came out, and you couldn't shut the hypocrites up!   It's hilarious.
Or, since he didn't have $37-million tucked away from questionable business practices and a rich daddy, perhaps he paid attention to the ramifications of abnormal deficit spending.
Uncle Sam hasn't tried to pass a law saying people can't install left-handed doornobs, to supposedly protect the doornobs of right-handed people. I guess right-handed people don't feel threatened by the minority. What a concept!
Anyone speaking English could well be an illegal from the UK then, right?   I guess Puerto Ricans better watch out too.

lol...you read my whole post only to conclude with "what's your point." Evolutionist brilliance on display. I'm not mistaking nothing for nothing. I know my stuff. You obviously know nothing and don't care to learn it.
Have you lost your mind? I got no idea what you are talking about.
Your signal to noise ratio was too low for my tastes: too much "wackiness" (I assume "wackiness" was what you were trying for) and irrelevant side discussions.

Look at Dunblane. Then look at Columbine. Who had the higher death toll?  How often do school shootings take place in Germany?  When was the last time somebody went driving and shooting in a killing spree in America?  Name the last mass public killing in America, in a public place where the number of victims reached double digit territory.  Go on Brady, we're waiting for you to prove that you actually have a point. Don't disappoint us.
And the Brady background check has not been repealed either so by your "logic" it must be effective.
Leave it to a leftist to cite a leftist forum for evidence that a leftist agenda is supported by dedicated leftists. Go figure, huh? This post just proves that attempting to reason with such an irrational thinker is truly a waste of time and effort.

Sounds like he/she has a problem with abstinence within the RCC and you have a thin skin about it.
Congratulations, Hunter. You have just accepted the 5 primary tenets of fundamentalism. So I guess that makes you a fundamentalist.  
Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does. Indeed, we'd probably be the darlings of the GOP. Unfortunately for your delusion, gays are no more or less wealthy on average than anyone else.
That post is not only off topic, but yet a further example of your being completely out of touch with reality.
I think you need to breathe in a bag for a while..then maybe have a nap.
Please do, because according to your source McVeigh called himself an Agnostic.  
You're equating atheism and homosexuality with terrorism and drug dealing? Really? Can you stop being a reactionary dolt long enough to convince me you're worth even trying to converse with? If not, I'll understand... and not be surprised.
Cower in fear of your god Easy, I'm not afraid, and nothing that you say is going to make me fear things which I believe to be imaginary.   Thankfully, our nation does not make laws based on your Phelpsian beliefs that god punishes the masses for the sins of others.
Sorry baby the story was in the religion of peace land. Your strawman is burning.

Did you notice how what I was responding to was said? I didn't think so. Your tunnel vision is showing again.   
You mus think you're pretty smart huh? Well guess what? You're confusing common, most common, majority, and norm. Lefthandedness is considerd common and the norm. You're using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant. Good try though.  Also left handed is genetic. It's not a gene but it's genetically related to the person's physical characteristics.
No. What the doctor was doing was going to church. He was not a monster. He was not a "sicko." He was a murder victim.   What his murderer did was murder.
Yes, we shouldn't let those slaves be citizens, they will burden our legal system since they will now have...OMG...rights!

Well then, you would immediately notice a 15% reduction in bullying! Rejoice!   
That does not surprise me. A whole world filled with people who look, speak, think, and do things different than you must be absolutely terrifying.  
Yep, you libs would love that. Then you could party on end without having your carnal consciences tweaked, LOL! No sin then no need for a Savior.
Yep, Martha is in trouble and the democrats are panicking.   I think the strong Independent support for her opponent is due to Martha's own lack of appeal.   By they way, I have to ask....since "The anointed one" was in your neck of the woods, did you get a peek at him? prehaps even wave at him (with all 4 fingers) ;)
Which you would do by having teachers teach kids that being gay is alright. You would teach those kids, against their parents wishes, that being gay is alright. You would do that after you make it legal WITHOUT A POPULAR VOTE. Seems that you really don't give a rat's XXX about this poor dead kid at all. You just see his corpse and throw him on top of your gay marriage banner. How noble of you.   
So I take it you don't accept my challenge on the basis that it is impossible? Why is it impossible? Or better yet, why don't we al just evolve into perfect, anti-sinning creatures with 500 IQ points a piece?  
I believe that the theory you speak of is called slavery; everybody is equal because they have nothing and need to work long and hard just to earn the privilege of living in order to serve their masters.
Ok, so you utterly missed the whole religion vs. faith part of the discussion, got it.  
Well, then, I guess that in America we can't possibly be safe from kill-happy gunners can we?
Oh, well, then that settles the argument doesn't it. It must be a person because she says so, now. Maybe she will change her mind again?
Wow ehat a brave new world you live in.... Now lets say just 1% of all gun owners resisted (in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land). With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this?
Here's some advice, if you're going to try and crack on me, make your 'jokes' (I'll be nice and call them that) less passive and more active, grammar-wise.   Crim-   A definition is the meaning of word that someone created using their own opinions. Is there a difference?   And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle.
So you advocate religion not because it is the truth, but instead because it gives you comfort and security? The opiate of the masses eh?
First off, kudos on getting the quotes right! It's much appreciated.  Now, what's your actual assertion? If you spell it out than we can put this definition debate in context, and maybe actually get somewhere.
ER, you're doing the God complex again. Sandra Fluke might not even use birth control because she may very well be celibate. Only God ... and ER who thinks he's God ... know.
I just bet you thought you were smart just now? I'll go you several...   How about:  1. Murder  2. Stealing  3. Adultery  4. Rape  Almost every culture since the dawn of civilization has put to death those who have trespassed those basics. But I guess you didn't get that on the Recovery Channel huh? Your idiocy is profound only as your ignorance.
Did your mummy read you scary stories when you were littler?
Oh, gee! There goes my irony meter. It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence. Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone.
Before you were claiming it was a slippery slope. Now you're claiming it's a strawman. Perhaps you don't understand what either term means.
But rather than be honest about your mistake, you just changed things without paying any attention to the fact that we've shown you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to the claims of the scientific community.. at least, not until somebody tells you. (And you accuse me of not having a teacher's mentality as I educate you in something you didn't previously know... How pathetic.)  
Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone? Either you are again using words you don't know the meaning of to make such an inaccurate statement, or you're just lying. So which is it penfold, are you ignorant or just being dishonest again? emoticonXConfused
Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?
Michael Moore Hates America is also coming out in theaters some time in October.
Hey, maybe some chosen by God religious fundamentalist will offer up his own daughters to be gang-raped, and then later have sex with those same daughters and children by them. You know, the way Lot did in the Bible. The one Peter called "a righteous man".
My point stands, just because you can't get it has no impact at all on its validity. YouTube - The jokes on you...
Tell me, how does one "steal land" from a nomad? emoticonXConfused
You forgot to mention that we would have to change our numbering system so that grasshoppers had 4 legs.
Ok, EF, so am i likely to win the lottery before i meet an alian?
Like I said, Catholic school. Or it could be that you're like 80 years old or something, because nowadays, if you talk about God or the Bible, then you don't get in trouble, you get criticized and made-fun-of, not only by your peers, but also by teachers.
I noticed that you do reply to mine. Perhaps you should reconsider since you're getting your ar$e handed to you with every reply I write. ;)
So, once again, the lack of criminal prosecution isn't due to the red herring that you claim, but rather the incompetence of the Justice Department. Franken's bill doesn't have a provision for making the Justice Department do its job, does it?
I don't really give a flying hippo's arse what you think - your posts here and on the other forums are repugnant, and as of now, you are being put on ignore (to take a page from Steeeeve).
Not only is Phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality. You were already called on using incorrect facts once...you might as well say "denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day"
I'm against polygamy, marriages with underaged minors and marriages to livestock as well, so don't feel that you are the only ones not "accomodated".   
<Flush>  Your own source said there's a cliff a mile and a half away, and I'm the liar? Go find it and jump off it, you flaming, incompetent, scatter-brained, dishonest cretin.
An objective test? Wow! Tell me, how do you prove this test is a true useful test? Please don't tell me reason or yet another objective test.  
Strange, I thought it was supposed to be a global flood that wiped out all of man except the chosen few. That would be 'involving Australia' one assumes.
So it doesn't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless, whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s: they are both equal? What planet do you live on, for it sure aren't the real world...
You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.
And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?
Is this satire? If so...bravo...well done. emoticonXGood If you are really serious...ummmm...excuse me. emoticonXEmbarrassed
Not to speak for Jim, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess it was "Rebuttlickan". Just a hunch.
On the bright side, it appears that the Rapture will solve the Social Security financing problem...
So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico.
Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis.
Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....  
Really??? Maybe you should do a little research before you make sweeping statements like that. -- http://www.rainbowbaptists.org/
Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of "proofs" reveal themselves. What's next, Nostradamus?
In my lifetime, we've made huge strides, but there's a lot more to learn.
And why would you say something like this? Because Christianity prohibits it? I can't think of any other reason.
It's a real mess, though you've to got to give them points for originality.
60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.
Do you need faith to know the sun will rise tomorrow or that 2 + 2 = 4 or to know that if you drop a rock it will fall to the ground?
I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant? That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!
I'm sure it is many a doctors' spiritual duty to relieve suffering, just as Jesus healed the sick.   Besides, who wants to go back to 40 year average lifespan, like they have in Afghanistan? Not me.
If the rejecting of the "lifestyle" results in death, beatings, job displacement, eviction, insults or inequality, then what would YOU call it? "Religious moral code?"
Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, "....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically." you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence.
Ah, so we shouldn't get all stirred up because little girls are singled out for slaughter?  Please excuse me for having misplaced priorities.
Sorry did I say pacifist?I meant yellow bellied pacifist.However if its any consolation, I meant anti's in general not just you Sinj.sorry if it sounded that way.
So, some parts of the Bible are erroneous oral history after all! What a refreshing admission.
Are you serious? Man I thought you actually had a brain in that dense hollow cranium of yours. You do realize there are Straight Atheists and GAY Christians right Gans?
You can start your own thread on how historical the Gospel accounts, etc., are.   How about dealing with the question now instead of running scared and going down another rabbit trail?
If it did that, then you might have won an argument by now.
The point being that nobody is spoiling Christmas for the children, you paranoid fruit cake.
While I fully realize you can't do math and thus why you consider it atheism, but post #96 and post #81 are not the same post. But then again, you were the one who argued that post 113 came before 106 so maybe you do think that complete failure to understand math and linear thinking is sane?   
Demolishing your "rebuttal" in post #14 does, however. You missed it.
Maybe because it's a loaded question? If another evolution hoax were discovered similar to Piltdown man, would you reject evolution and become a Christian? :p
You are the only one in this discussion that shows a predominant lack of logic or reason. Your position has been proven wrong, get over it .
What about them? Is this a question?   Um. Have you read Leveticus? And I mean, read it. Not skimmed it.   Because, God loves everybody. Are you reaching?   And what does fast and loose mean? I'm confused. I think you are trying to label me.. but I'm not quite sure what I'm being labled as.   What part about people burning in hell for eternity?
Symbiote seems to have had a large hair across his butt.
Because of your question " What is your definition of pure", I now know how to make soap. I'll never stink again!!! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis. Ya know stuff that makes sense.
Is it possible to be an adult and be as clueless as you seem to be?  This was in response to the question did Jesus not believe in evolution.  Only someone with similar mental capacity to yours would ask such a question.  It seems unfair I have to answer this senseless comment you added to the nonsense.
We are figments of our own imaginations, sent here by Satan to annoy the faithful! emoticonXAngel
Well, in the case of a creationist, the bias determines what evidence will be discarded, what evidence will be twisted, what evidence will simply be ignored.
ah yes....."Gaytheist," the terminal homosexual atheist liar at various forums such as IIDB and Tweb misrepresents me to some guy who studies tadpoles. The little XXXX liar atheist claimed to the author that I used his paper as "evidence" of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she couldn't back up when I pressed her on it. This was merely his response to her strawman lie. Funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is.
What's your evidence that the Gospel prophecies are "spurious claims"? Seems like you've bought into a scalding case of rational tunnel-vision (or political correctness, if you prefer).
That explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? ROTFLMAO
Aw shucks! And I reckon in Kansas they won't ever care whether or not you learn how to spell ATHEIST.
BOY-HOWDY!! Why don't you let me know how you really feel? I have not tried to demonize anything. Rap music does that to itself without any help from me. Rap is the lowest form of music that I have ever heard. It is just too primative for my tastes. Once again, I am not a racist, nor am I sexist. I do my own washing. I wish you and your child nothing but the best in life. Some folks think that exposing young children to Rap music is a form of child abuse, I agree with those folks.  P.S. Tell that Southern girl to find another room-mate, you sound like a horrible role model. Well, got to go wash some more underwear.
That's because the Taliban in Afghanistan didn't have any oil with which to bribe them.
:p I wish! If I did, I'd be as wealthy as the Church, who does. emoticonXHoho
Make up your mind. Is it because of diet or is it because of evolution. It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it.
I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.
Never thought of that. If that "person" has rights, do they have responsibilities? Could a fetus be charged for causing toxemia? How about suing the little tyke for giving mom varicose veins and stretch marks?
Yea right you are likely to know. Stick with the enema hotline.
So, you're just an anti-geologist, anti-cosmologist, anti-archaeologist, anti-physicist, and probably a few more that I can't be arsed to think of right now. *shrugs* Might as well get it over with and just say you're an anti-science religious nutter.
Just like it's the job of the gun control lobby to try and pass an overwhelming, unreasonable level of fear of an inanimate object?
Talk about incoherent wishful thinking. Instead of unsubstantiated claims and baseless attacks, why don't you provide, oh, I don't know, mybe some peer-reviewed EVIDENCE? You know, that little old thing that is required for anyone to take your wild claims even remotely seriously?
I like the Grape Flavored best, But I won't be drinking any KoolAid with you or one of your religious Cult Fanatics...   And why would I be embarrassed about telling the truth?....
Well, if history were binding we would still have slavery...and abortions being illegal for that matter. Something being done for a long time doesn't mean it makes it in the constitution. I don't know which part of the constitution has a "preserve history" clause.  
Oh yeah right, like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them, can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling.
I guess it is a bad thing to make his wife cry but the republicans can make any hatefilled statement of attack against gay and lesbian americans and that is ok.
Why don't you answer Bryan's post above troll? He has some important information you would never figure out by yourself?
What! You mean that WE don't want to do all of those things? Who knew? I didn't get the memo? emoticonXConfused   And you forgot "make Seniors eat dog food". emoticonXGood

So what are you claiming now? That all this time that Rosie was making fun of the Chinese, she's actually been Chinese all the while? Because that's the only legitimate way you could draw a parallel with those people who are hypocritically attacking gays while being gay themselves.
Well, if you combined his plan with all the others, then make all the cuts at once, you would be like 25% of the way there!!   Come on, Steeeve...we have limited material to work with here.....

That "brilliant" statement has absolutely NOTHING to do with the original point.   ...later

Since you're so fond of reporting personal attacks to the mod, maybe someone should return the favor to you? emoticonXRolleyes
Apparently Archie thinks this is golf, where the lowest score wins. Who wants to clue him in?
Are you trying to be funny in a "I'm the one who drew attention to this aspect in the first place, but now I'm going to criticize you for talking about what I drew attention to" type mentality?  
Um, Bassman, so you, the one person in the world who is as "pure as the wind-driven snow," is the one who may judge others, including Democrats. Um, for the record I grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of "wind-driven snow" and it was not particularly pure. A feeble and laughable metaphor.

You mean like Korea? Oh wait we are still there....  Is Israel a nice secure place safe from terrorism? The notion that Iraq will be without conflict will not occur in our life time.
Confucius, that is one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble that has ever been manufactured.
I get what you are trying to do but it doesn't work. You might as well say "let's print a bunch of money...pay off the debts...and then force people to burn it!".
Only in your mind could lying about me be telling the truth smiley. And if you had any concept of what truth is, you wouldn't be an anti-christian atheist my spiritually blind friend. emoticonXAngel
I think pedophilia is a disorder as opposed to an illness but I'd have to look back at some psychology books. How do I define illness? Well, I have a few contexts for this. The flu...obvious illness. Christians feel that sin is an "illness", so in that sense we are all rather ill :). As for wrong...same deal.  
Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means?   Also that's what jeans were called before the word "jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?)   So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies?   Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment.
Odd. I can't seem to find any racial slurs or racist ideology in those sentences. In fact, I don't see any race or races in general even mentioned. You're just one of those people who thinks you can win a discussion by accusing your opponents of being racist. Sorry simone, but in the real world, people can disagree with your leftist views (which are barely existent) without being racist.
And oddly enough you have been given several on silver platters. Perhaps you need to visit a neurologist and get checked for memory problems? Just to remind you once more - SICKLE CELL TRAIT is a mutation AND it benefits the phenotype under specific definable conditions. Do you really want to get hit about the head with that bat yet again?
You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated. People will have abortions legal or not legal. At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger.
So if Jitobear's mother had the option to abort Jitobear in utero, you want Jitobear to have the same option with any children she carries? That's awfully progressive of you.
I think it would be best for neither one to have a gun, as there would be no chance of me getting hurt. After all, I could beat up a guy armed with a plastic fork. However, if the hijacker has a gun, I'd like someone (not me, I'm half blind in each eye, I'd probably hit a passanger or something) to have a gun.
  So what do ya Say! Come On. Be reasonable! Do it for the children! Or don't we care about these children because they weren't hurt or killed by a firearm?
Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd (people who support such laws as car registration) also own cars. More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white.
Is North Korea a bastion of peace and good-living? Nope. Is it religious? Nope. Therefore obstacles to 'peace' don't necessarily have to be tied in with religiosity.  Hope that's spelt out enough for you. Try to keep up.

Yup, I get the drift. You're the sort that is in denial about how he feels about gays; equating tolerance for gays with tolerance for murderers, while pretending you're doing something else. Now I know how you think, thanks!
Worship me and I'll bless you too. With money of course. He can't even give you money. I am the true god and I created the mindset that he was a god in him. Worship me and spread the word about the true religion. Everyone who joins my church will instantly get $1,000 and after a week of membership you will get $1 million. The end of the week is when my project is and then you can go into the real world. All those who didn't believe in me will be destroyed when my world I created gets to the dump.
Hmmm, was that an ad hominem attack? You know, what you accuse others of doing? Hypocrite.
OMG, are you for real? I'd think that if you saw a plane flying low, being chased by a fighter jet, you'd get out of the way. Any SANE person would...  Further, you'd be peeved if you found out that it was your govt. being completely insensitive (not to mention wasteful). The govt. screwed up...if it had been Bush you'd be crying bloody murder.
You of course have documentation of Darwin laying out his plan as to how to weasel evolution into classrooms to oust theism, right? No? You're making it all up? Shocking.  
Well, considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are, I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others.

Dude, my own father had hospice care in my home up until he died. I think I know a thing or two about it. None of what you say disproves that end-of-life can still be a scary thing.

You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.  As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?  Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men.
Eighty-nine times. Still quite a junior partner. I must admit that he doesn't like to be slighted though, as evidenced by Luke 12:10. One can say some nasty things about the Son of Man, and all's fine. But say one off-colored comment about the Holy Ghost and it's lakes-o-fire time. He needs to get thicker skin, IMO. Do ghosts have skin, BTW?   
Do you have to have human organs to be considered a person? Who made this rule??? You? What if you get lung removed...are you less of a person? So around 8 weeks though you believe it is in fact a human?

Trying to argue with a person who is babbling nonsense is not my idea of a productive time to spend my time. I've explained myself and that's the end of it.   You can label my posts anything you want but that doesn't mean anything. It just means you are proficient in throwing out insults. So for purposes of this discussion I crown you the "insult king" of this forum.
He stated that " statistics show that firearms cause aggression in individuals", no mention of the word can anywhere in there that I saw.
That is exactly what he is here for. To spread god's.. 'love'.

What is this "we" stuff? Got a mouse in your pocket? I thought god was going to destroy it...not "we".

They might need some help, as well as do you. And as contrary to your side subject, I think I am quite different than you.
Can cause aggression, does not mean that it will though. Alcohol has a far greater record of this but yall are not trying to ban that. So do women but we arent going to ban them now are we, Sorry but I was in a marriage from hell and just had to throw that in.
Nice attempt at an audition. Since the law firm you hired is supposed to find a director and president for your crumbled .org do you think you will get the job? What's the matter, didn't Hennigan cut it after the other lawyer fled when he saw the handwriting on the wall? emoticonXGood

BOY-HOWDY!!!!! You have spoken the truth and spoken it well. Welcome to you from the conservative South.
So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves.
And, I'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker, right?
Ok if we can not use guns. Can we use baseball bats? Is that OK with you?
And the UN seems to feel it's necessary to spell out that you have the right to marry and have a family.
And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work.
Nonsense. Just look at all the great things that the Dark Ages did for Europe!
Yeah, cause there are sooo many 100 year old corks just kickin around.

Someone's help? Whoever are you talking about? It wasn't any much work at all. A simple search. I'm pointing it out to you in the hopes that you'll get some new material. That and the fact I'd rather not see you banned.
I guess you never thought that many Cathoilics have gays in their family, or should they ask them to take their lives ?
You'll never have that problem comic relief. You'll always be young mentally.
Where do you get off saying that kind of tripe to somebody?  That kind of insane comment is typical of far left loons like you who lie for a living and don't have the common sense of a fence post.  And that goes for Jo Bennett too if he's agreeing with you.  Cretins.
Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?  Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world.
This will kill innovation. do you know how many years a start up business might be in the red before it generates a profit? Why bother when you know you are going to be clubbed as soon as you realize a profit? Yep, way to incentivize business there...  
No, the law didn't specifically mention gays, or dwarfs, or one-eyed pirates, or 6 toed individuals. emoticonXRolleyes   
Archie, the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says, every accepted definition of the words socialism, statism, capitalism, fascism and nazism. If we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words, it STILL does not work because the argument is STILL illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it.   Face it. You got pwned. Are you really not bright enough to recognize that?  
Did you actually read it? I suspect not. Did you think that I wouldn't? I suspect so. Did you think that no one here would have any knowledge of good old "Kimisaurus" (that's what it was tagged when Kim was telling us about it)? I suspect so.  
Dragons and Dinosaurs coexisting only recently? hmm when they did dissapear? Maybe Conan the Barbarian killed them all!
No EasyRidden.. It's you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution. America is a nation which has always had a population of christians, but it was never a Christian nation. The Words God, Jebus, Holy Spirit.. are NOT included in any of the founding documents. You can continue to ignore the history, you're the one looking like a buffoon.
But being American, she knew killing Iraqi children would be the right thing to do FOR TOTAL VICTORY FOR AMERIKA!!1!!
i assume you can demonstrate that everyone that opposes or critiques gay rights are personally attacking an individual or group? please, be my guest
I've got a better compromise. We'll keep our magazines in whatever size we please, and we'll ban you, J Miro, Simone, and a random forum troll to be named later. That sounds fair and even in terms of trade to me.
I guess it's a good thing I wasn't replying and/or talking to you then. But thanks for your input, it has been noted.
Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence. You mean like Bill Ayers (sic) and his wife or Carl Rowen? Wait my bad they aren't from the right.
Well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.   Careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. Not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb!   You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.   So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.   Thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. Kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and MOST creationists use the KINDS thing as a support for their arguments.
ROFL....Yeah, right, since you 'left wingers' seriously see yourself as center-right.....whaddayah know?
And you're baffled that you don't have more intelligent debate with people. I'm shocked.
Math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it.
It has been 33 years. The allies managed to stop the holocaust in only two. You guys are certainly dragging your feet at stopping the great American "holocaust" against "unborn babies."
It truly is sad when an opponent is friendlier than an ally, Mega. At least Ian responded in a friendly way, and me and him don't even agree on this issue.
Archie, you're not one of those Westboro Baptist Chuch types, are you? You don't buy that stuff about 'God Hates the ### Army' and 'God hates America' do you?
Oh thats not politically kerect and secially wif the chosen one doing the world apology toure I don't see that going down.   Well lay a few on us sin baby. Give us the deal.
I guess they could if they knew where all the parts were located. Oh, I would think they would be in hell. I can't imagine "God" would have anything to do with mass murderers; do you?   BTW, this is Osama's technical guide for the terrorists.   http://www.almostaproverb.com/images4/osama_dummies.jpg
So let's just kill them and be done with it. Is that what you're saying?
And what does he mean by that? You apparently don't have a clue. Tell me, do you have any idea what "secondary cause" is?
Aw declare victory and slither off eh. I made an assertof fact that was backed up. You made a strawman of abandonment. No one made that claim but you. They come here because they don't get the proceedure in a timely manner. Get it now? Hence you lose as usual.
Actually, isn't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing? Creationists even have a magazine formally called "Ex Nihilo" (changed to "Creation" because creationists didn't know what it meant.)
So you carry grenades and 75 pounds of gear, all while wearing camouflage fatigues and can call in an airstrike bombing?
Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.
I don't care for the respect of utter nincompoops. I'm happy to tolerate them, but don't expect me not to laugh at them.
Primarily from your side of the aisle in all arguments. You really described yourself a T.
So this singularity that appeared out of no were became a greater singularity which took on perfect balance and form?
Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you
So you're claiming that you "transformed" from part of your mother to a human. So you're claiming that you were once almost your mom's arm or leg? lol! Biologically, this is simply a farce statement.
Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.
You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.
Selective reading huh? Well, there is none so blind as he who will not see.
Well with thinking challenged individuals like slimjim floating around it is no wonder we have a rogue agency with no oversight attacking the honest citizens. See Ruby Ridge and Waco for examples.
You know you have outwitted a conservative thinker when they completely dodge the argument you have made.
Now you are being insulting. Evolution makes no statments about your god. For that matter, neither does cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics or geology.
Ah yes resort to attack when you have no case - perfect example. Its a marvellous demonstration of projection.
So if a jew tells a big nose joke, he's saying that all jews have big noses? This is a joke thread; I posted a joke, get over it.
And you have just described "creation science." No application of the scientific method. No testing. The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun. I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below. You show that you are what you decry.
Functioning? The fetus breathes freely? It cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable? It demands attention? It smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it?  Wow! Didn't know that fetuses were that active and functional.
i dont like watching videos. or following steps. isnt there just one thing i could do? you know, like be forgiven or whatever?
They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world.
I don't see how you figure that. Are you intoxicated by any chance? I'm not trying to insult you, I'm serious. You're not writing well, and I'm not refering to your point either.
Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march.
Thank you for this thoughtful exposition on the historicity of your loving mentor.
You jsut don't get it. You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not. What part of that do you not understand. You say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. How cruel can you be
Er . . . how do you know that god hasn't told anyone to kill enmasse (in the last 2000 years)? Does he run all his orders by you?
Where? I don't see it. My monkey brain's fine but my eyes aren't what they used to be.  I'm guessing we're through discussing the legality of armed self-defense in Australia given the flurry of OT links?
Oh, if we only had the requisite absolute civilian gun bans, sick things like this would never happen! Huh Brady?
Maybe you aren't aware, but something that hasn't happend but has a possibility or probability of happening is potential, so the word is accurate to describe it. And since I'm sure Steeeeve (the dictionary worshipper) will step in, here is the definition:  
So your biased reading of the Bible coupled with your personal flaws and your misunderstanding of science is the basis of your religiosity? Somehow I don't think that's something you'd really want to brag about...
Well then, I guess I must be a turkey-sandwich worshipper! emoticonXAngel
But I thought it was the easy gun laws in the U.S. that made Mexico's cities a shooting gallery? Same as L.A. and less than D.C.?   Amid Drug War, Mexico Less Deadly Than Decade Ago
Again he was under attack. Listen to yourself. And talk about a parrot?   No one is arguing Saddam was a saint. But he wasn't and threat and he wasn't insane enough to commit sucide. You are too busy being a lemming and being led over the cliff with president Shrub (Molly Irvins -- GW is to small to be a Bush). ;)
After Rump Limpballs and his XXXXX followers started calling me a "Feminazi", I was granted a license to call TeaBaggers TeaBaggers.
Better still , you pop down to your local army barracks and explain it to thememoticonXClown
So? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman's uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds.
  well there is an educated answer :) thanks for the feedback
That is a completely subjective assessment. Thelmoose and Unkerpaulie were already quick to dissociate themselves from any smugness or self righteousness on this very thread.   It's a schism! I'm filing for their excommunication! emoticonXWow
You should watch where you cast stones, kido. Your original post is an example of a straw man...not mine. You should be more careful before operating a gun...you just yourself in the foot. LOL!
Damn, had 2 of them on my doorstep yesterday. Why didn't I think of that?
You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts.
From the threads I see, you would be banned in 10 posts, and everything deleted. The level of discourse over there intelligence over there makes ER looks semi-intelligent.
So the Establishment Clause was included to promote atheism, eh?
None... unless she uses abortion as a form of birth control and has them regularly.
well, then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells? what's their reason then? we don't know, because the doctors might not want everything that they're doing be on the front page of every newspaper. they have their reasons for their actions, and they just don't want people like you to know about them. or...they already have their reasons published and everything and you're just 2 close-minded 2 take the information in.
That's right, a broken clock tells the right time twice a day, and gun hating hoplophobes are never right.
Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing as you make unfounded claims without supporting them with even the slightest proof. But hey, talks cheap; and you've proven you've got plenty of that since showing up here.
...that is on every single one of his posts? Still going to claim you read other peoples stuff properly?
And I suppose you feel it would've been better if she died at the hands of a knife-wielding killer?
I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds.
Well you'd know fascist wingnuts for sure. Hitting a meeting tonite?
Yawn.. you are so obsessed with gay sex. I am not. Enough said.
Oh, yea. You are damn right those European socialists are dangerous. Americans might look and see their governments actually doing something USEFUL for the people and think that we should have that here.   I am surprised we have not nuked them yet.
WHAT??? Jito, are you saying that motherhood is difficult? emoticonXWow Now that's a shock...
Did you even read ythe OP? Did you even read the title?   Pointless distinction? Huh.   I understand what you are saying. I also know you are changing your argument. When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it.   
You would not celebrate Osama being out of the picture? Maybe not throw a party, but a not even a simple "yippee!"?   Yeah, right. What a load.
But there seem to be so darn many of them, everywhere you look among the religious right. Why is that? Can't they go out and recruit people with IQs somewhat above room temperature?
You should use the same quote when whining about use of partial quotes, and not introduce different ones. Nozza made a false assertion and was refuted with his own words. You introduce a different false assertion and fail. Epically.
Could you avoid your constant use of strawman`s fallacies please?
Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either. Then again, to be Christian, you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too. The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.
Yes, some people are jumping ship, which is a crying shame. STICK TO YOUR GUNS MEN! WE'RE WINNING!
Want to know how to make a gay sex liberal mad and whine? Tell him the truth.  Then they get their knickers in a wad and whine for the politically correct policeman.  p.s. Unless Mother Theresa repented she will not have gone to heaven either.
Sorry, I was busy looking at your Base21 source, the one where you post your own article. I figured someone had made up an article on it.   Hey, according to PNC=WW3, if I don't like the people who put the information into the State Dept. website, I don't have to believe it. That's according to him.
But you are the accuser. I've read the Bible and I have studied religion, more than you can imagine. I have also studied biology, performed experiments and reached conclusions. The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself.
You say some of us are lying and then you say you apologize "if" we're "somehow" offended. Gee, that's mighty white of you.
You're right it'll be fighting the war in Iraq. )Nah, really it'll be from social security, etc etc.
Too late. I am a child of the 70's. My mind evaporated decades ago.emoticonXDonno
Thats why I say my gayness is His gift and blessing to me. There is nothing more joyous then gay sex.
You missed out mean-spirited, which fits like a very well fitting glove.
Which ones? Ineffective how?   I'd guess the laws weren't struck down simply because too many people broke them.
glad to know you bring spelling into this. Shows where you are in the argument. And where did the life saving question come from?
I disagree. Well, only in that I think it's high time we held everybody to a higher standard. We should suspend hetero marriage until they clean up their act!
Oh gosh, silly, silly me, not blaming an entire group of people for something a few nutjobs did. My, I'm so embarassed for being so intolerant and thinking that! emoticonXBangheademoticonXBanghead  
I don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one.
You still don't get it do you, Smiley... emoticonXBanghead   If cupcakes were human? It would.
Every time the KKK burns a cross NRA members are there. So what? Every time they burn a cross Christianity is there.
Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity ).
First off, no one says that if there is evil, there can't be a God. They say that if there's evil, then God can't be omnipotent and all benevolent. Let's keep the topics straight. Also, I see no way in which the existence of good bolsters the argument that God exists. I could posit the existence of a God of popcorn, and then say "look, here's some popcorn, my God must be real!" Somehow, I don't think that would convince you.
Lotsa gay animals out there, man. Wonder what Jaaaman's sources are. He seems very perturbed by homosexuality.
Good observation! He is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content. He is one of the more fellatious people I know and you won't find him taking notice of the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land either.
You can take a horse to water. I provided evidence to support my assertion. You provided ............ "Oh no it isn't!"
probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.
So you evolved and the aryan race was created by God? I have never heard that before.
I'm not interested in who isn't hitting on you. Do you want an ugly, flaming, gay cellulite blubber-wench hitting on you for three years or not??? Or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you??  For the record, gays make normal men's skin crawl, and not in a good way. So keep the spiritually-challenged heathens out of the men's barracks, and out of their showers. Just because you and the rest of the pro-gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok doesn't mean the rest of society does.
Of course you don't. It's the natural humanistic way of thinking.
Jyoshu, stop drinking the Kool-Aid before your brain is totally fried.
So taking peoples rights away is an american value? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal. After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also.
Will the Catholics ever elect somebody who is not a complete knob? He speaks just like he knows something about gay relationships. emoticonXRolleyes
You never bought something you liked? You never went somewhere with someone you liked or went to meet them?   
It is supported, I have shown that it is true. Your only argument is to claim that organisations that perpetrate genocide don't agree that it is genocide. Wow what an argument you have.  
Oh, oh, and don't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment's text, which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions, in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state.
And here it is, corrected to remove that little hint of sensationalism that you feel is needed to drum up support for your cause.
Only in the mind of a secular humanist atheist would it make sense. emoticonXGood
What, you mean like this story (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003? Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example.
So if I go out and buy a Brand X car and then regret it a year later, does that mean that nobody should be allowed to go out and buy a Brand X car? Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive? Sounds kinda fascist to me.
Turned?  What do you mean turned?  (Oh man! Got you one more time! Brutal! lol)
As compared to "Truth" (capital T). Yes, creationist theocrats have this tendency to portray their subjective beliefs as truth, their wishful thinking as facts. No surprise there.  
This remark would be funny if you didn't actually mean it....
Based on what besides your own immediate knee-jerk denials?  You're always in the tank for the Bible bashers.
Abortion is not immoral? End of story? Simone, are you trying to impose your own personal moral code upon me? Well I never....
pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ?   your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.  My advice to you ?  keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.
I truly mourn for you cookie. I pity the emptiness and shallowness of your soul. emoticonXCry
Brave words. Next they'll be limiting free speech. Oh wait. Done that already.  
Indeed true. God created man in his own likeness and man returned the favor. Man created a vindictive, vengeful, and vicious god, according to the Bible. So where does a loving god come from?
Right. Catholics say prayers to a woman that they hate. Next!
ROFL you don't even believe that given the democrat party's known escapades. I do hope you haven't stroked out due to the Brown victory. Let the games begin!
You really don't get it. The best thing about a free market is when someone acts like a fool they get burned. Thanks to government intervention and regulation when someone acts like a fool they get bailed out.   If you like we can have the trains run like Amtrak.
Oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? GASP! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations. Just because their not closes binded right wing bigots doesn't mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different...
Just out of interest, which particular aspect of "truth" are you getting at here?
Ah yes, the 'Let's pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult, therefore god exist' routine. That arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique, or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to Christianity. It does drive them away, so please, be my guest and keep on trying to use it. I figure the ratio of people you drove away from Christianity to those people who were converted to Christianity from you must be way lop sided.
Interesting.... have you ever been to a schoolyard recently? I think the "taunts" are more directed at gays. Like "f@ggot" and "fairy". What taunts do you get on a daily basis? What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo.
But that is how creationism works - half truth. Evolution is a theory but don't make it quite clear that in science the word theory doesn't mean half-assed guess, as it does in creationism. Check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the Patterns of Cumulative Change paragraph on page 7. That is pure YEC. And you aren't a YEC?
I think we're seeing a culture war. Hardly seems a fair fight though, since only one side has any.:p
You'd have to drown a few puppies too. Kittens might do, but you might fall a little short.
I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?
Oh boy,,.. I got ignored with a potty remark. Why is that not surprising?
Why do "they" want it to be true? Some "gay" science agenda?
Seems all the drills would broadcast when they had a leftie. Just could wait for that case of M-1 thumb or the hot one down the shirt.
So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?
Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view.
I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?
Well that lets out most of the supreme court when RvW comes up! And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote. Perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea!
I see you missed the entire point of my post. Good job on analyzing the sarcastic opening though.
Wow! ...... If your interpretation were correct, there would be a connection between his post and the USSR! But it's not, and there isn't.
Oh, I see. So America does not care for the rights of the people? America cares only for the opinion of the majority? Hrm, that's funny. I fail to remember learning that part in all my US history classes. When did the founding fathers say that? Where in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or the Bill of Rights might I find such a notion?  'Rouge
Is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?
What does spelling have to do with your own opinion? Again this isn't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone's spelling and just didn't answer the question. This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion. It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate.
So then how do you know that abortion isn't in the plan then? If as you say we have "VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE"
since when has religion been pragmatic or based upon systems that works?  Obvious answer: never.
A nameless face to the feds? In this era of paranoia and fear and overgrown governments? As if any of us are private and unknown individuals anymore.
The poor in the US certainly seem to eat more than the rich in most countries.
Hey Jitobaby - if you're that insecure with your beliefs that you have to throw this kind of a snit when people are making a case contrary to your failed radical liberalism, then maybe you need to watch Michael Moore on TV instead of reading my posts.
Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional.
Just because you fail to realize what the article says doesn't make what you said true. Since you seem to like logical fallacies can you reconginze which one you just committed?
So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.
So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.
Crouching Libertarian, Hidden cost. Can't pay extra expenditures get's ya penalized! No special education requirements (they are't unders state or federal control!) No requirement to moniter student progress...that seems safe.
Yes...I think I would agree with you. That's what happens when you have superstition coupled with self-imposed ignorance I suppose. It's a shame!
Please tell me, why did you believe your pastor, but not me? What did he say that was so convincing? And please, PLEASE, tell me what you think the Bible might not be saying that could have any bearing on this in the slightest. How can the fact that we don't know Ehosh's second cousin twice removed have any bearing on this at all, or whatever you think the Bible wasn't saying?  
I was hoping that talking in Old English would help him understand.
Where, exactly, did the article say that bacteria exhibit intelligence????
Right on! The Obama administration is a colossal financial disaster. If he doesn't have another trillion dollars to XXXX he can't do anything. Tax and spend - that's all those liberal turkeys know how to do.
Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders.
You mean you've spent your good, hard-earned money on his revisionist follies? ROTFLOL!! You could have had a six pack to really make your day.
Why does they admin let EZ post comments like this to other people, if he can't be vicl and debate like an adult to others, why is he here......to spread god's love ...right?
Just which god might that be? Yahweh? Krishna? he Great Spirit? Allah?  Please specify.
Looks like dancing in the blood of innocents to me.
Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want "guilty by association" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice.
Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.
All science is provisional. For absolutes, we look to your interpretation of your bible. That's always absolute and beyond any correction.  
I can understand your disappointment. Its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions. No easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim. But if you really work hard at it for another decade or so you may recover yet. Best of luck and don't fall for the quacks peddling quick cures.
Oh look, Gansao the blowhard is still living in his world of ignorance and denial... like his daddy Ezridden.   You couldn't educate a rock ya stupid bastard.emoticonXBye
I guess since he said so it must be true... poor daewoo, just remember only whiners point out logic fallacies like ad hominem and argument by dismissal.
Are you sure? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida. His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida. If he is retired, he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs. Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time. Somehow 2 tours turned into 4, midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor.   All in all, VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying, lack of education and reading comphrension problems.
I have. Yet I can`t seem to be able to do the creative math that will show that europe will become pre-dominatly muslim in any near future.  
Evidence? We're talking religion here. Religion. If there were evidence, then it would be science.
But religion is not a topic for science classes. Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative.
Perhaps then the problem is a shortage of fiber in you diet?
Our pumping of CO2 is certaintly not helping. Does that mean we should pump gasses and make people in big cities sneeze?
I could have labeled my post "TRAP" and you wouldn't notice. Tell me, are these two contradictory:  
If truth makes you uncomfortable, feel free not to respond to me. I will continue to point out hypocrisy , and bigotry. I'll mock anybody who says 'slavery wasn't all that bad' either.
Yes, I will mark that on my calendar for future reference.....get help man....really...you need it.
Seriously, in part is Waxy saying, I was here first? (It's my forum, I'll whine if I want to.)
I also took a look and think your evaluation is charitable.
Actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. And anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides.
Ah yes, the ever popular 3rd grade "they started it" response. Didn't jesus say to turn the other cheek?
Care to post some proof or should everyone just believe it because you say it?..
You show me the post where I said I thought terrorists killing children was a good idea and I will eat my keyboard.
But if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. You are a rightwing hypocrite, Archie Baby.
And you know what I think? I think that everyone who doesn't have sex 24 hours a day 7 days a week is denying human beings life every second. I'm sure some of those sperm would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you don't think they should live [/sarcasm]. Why don't you think this? Why embryos? Embryos are the one thing that have great potential to cause harm in a woman, and you just so happen to choose them as human beings. Very suspicious...
True they should have passed raincoats and knee boots to protect peoples clothes from the XXXX that the president was spewing out.
This, coming from an atheist. How consistently shallow of you. emoticonXRolleyes
yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands. It's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves.
Well it depends he could always be a sperm donor or make some Lesbian couple happy :)
No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is "pro-evolution". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's "faith-based" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach
How about other religious theories. What about teaching about the sun god? I don't mean that they believed that, but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe. Actually let's also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the Earth and other massive objects. We should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe.  
Excuse me, I stand corrected. For 'pretend' please substitute 'wrongly believe'.
No surprise there. You would have to invest some thought to define something. Why don't you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary?
Actually, I don't sneer at you. I laugh at you. And I don't attack your intelligence but your knowledge. You are intentionally ignorant.
That sort of warms the cockles of my heart. Namely that some Europeans might be disinclined to visit or stay here. Don't let the door hit you in the buttocks on the way out.
So the BBC folks are frauds and liars? You really are an idiot aren't you? Piltdown Bird is a colorful way of saying it was a Piltdown like fraud.   National Geographic knew it was a fake and published the article anyway.  Of course you probably still believe in the original Piltdown don't you?  You probably believe the Nebraska Man and Haeckels speechless apes were real too.  There is an echo when you think isn't there?
Cool I want to be free of the regulation that I wash my hands before preparing other peoples food. After all it should be my choice to wash my hands after going to the restroom and I should be able to make that choice without restraint. In your world there are no courts, police, or governments to hold me accountable for killing someone or giving them hepatitis.
Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?
your "minds"? How many do you have? Oh, and "I wanted to see what inferior it was"? Nice example of your supposed superiority.
I'm glad that you're the one living in fear of becoming a criminal for defending your family and not me.
I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.
And you tell people not to call you a gay basher? LOLemoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXCensored   I know very well what faux means - that is the reason it is bashing to call someone's marriage that.
I won't hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you've composed. Guess we'll chalk it up to puffery.
You see, that's the problem: "generally". You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country.
Well, at least you are more consistent about equality than a lot of people in your movement.   
I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above.
And yet after investigating for over a year, our inspectors agree with me, not you. Hmmm.
All sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you.
If you don't get all 10 according to landover you are not a true christian.
Sorrowfully, you are so right. That's exactly why we have all "suffered" for 8 long years. Sheer. . . . .no I refuse to write it!! :)
I'm actually in the Detroit Subs with one kid in a Blue Ribbon High School and two in college nearby. And yes, the mayor's got the bling goin on in his wife's city-leased Escalade. I'm not sure if it has "dubs" on it or not, though, but I bet the stereo's kickin'. :)
HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is.   6) And the standard "theistic evolution" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it.
So what you are saying is that the actual purpose of prison is to be raped in the shower by some 400 pound guy called Betty? Or brutalised by a guard with an inferiority complex...and these don't strike you as cruel and unusual?
Isn't the point pretty obvious- that exposure to a gun can raise testosterone levels and trigger violent and aggressive thoughts and actions?
Yea they get over it in a year or two. Haaa Haaa
So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women?
Spain, unlike most modern democracies, very very recently had the uh.. privilege of living under a strong, "moral" government that supported the uh.. "family values" so important to the right.   That they are running like hell away from it should tell people something.
So now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?   I expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? Am I to believe that you are a soldier there now?   Your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. I posted exactly what I meant to and you went off on a tangent. I asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if "show me yours before I show mine?" Pitiful.
Oh, sorry, I didn't think that was a serious answer. Thanks.
Hehehe. Sounds like an American in a big SUV looking at $4/gallon gasoline with a maxed out credit card listening to fundamentalist talk radio.
Cute. And I can come up with about 5,000 to 7,000 examples that do have a bright orange muzzle.
Oh...come on Steeeeve...you know Bush is actually making it worse. After all, it is happening on Obama's watch, and we have got to have someone to blame. Bush was the president...let's just blame him. emoticonXRolleyes
Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime? Or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander?
So you're saying that God is a "respector"?-of-persons - iow, the mom's "more"-important to *God*? than the unborn.
I'm one of those cruel heartless bastards that thinks the Constitution doesn't apply to terrorists. Break out the cattle prods and "LET'T PARTY" emoticonXRolleyes
And the funeral dirge of the Left and comparisons to Nazi Germany and/or the collapse of the Roman Empire will begin in 3....2.....
Losing again I see. Don't change the subject. How are supporting 'gay sex debauchery' and lying in any way synonymous?  You have made the accusation. Back it up.  If different words are too much for your miniscule brain to cope with, I suggest you try yelling your hogwash on a street corner, where less people will be able to see how much of a fool you are.
I'd be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who doesn't even believe in what they're selling. Those teachers may teach it, but they don't believe in it.
No. Not only are you wrong, you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. You oppose evolution you say, but you have no idea of what it is. Most educated creationists not only admit evolution, they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh.
When I want the opinion of a spiritually-dead nincompoop I'll call you.
So, it's a proven fact that children denied the act of abortion suffer negative effects? Hmmmmmm
But you sure don't hesitate to portray them that way when you use one to bolster the other! Or when you fail to actually (GASP) qualify the matter by noting the differences as well as the similarities. Hey, it's just accuracy, so why get in a fuss over it, huh? emoticonXRolleyes Why not go ahead and invoke the Jewish genocide while you're at it, or call anyone who has a different opinion "Hitler?" I mean it's the same sort of generalization.  
Neat my very own living spell check I can't wait to see well it works.
Here is yet another example of Duo holding other people's arguments to a higher standard than he holds his own. Duo, you said "Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity." Are you right? Anyone claiming to know age on these boards without evidence is insanity? Duo, if you are right, you are calling yourself insane. That's not going to help you out on the credibility meter. Perhaps you might want to amend some of you posts?
So, I'm wondering, did you neglect to note the reason because you "forgot" or because it would weaken your statement and its connotation that we really didn't want him that badly? emoticonXConfused   
There you go. It's difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of when the facts are the facts!
And there you have the "***** Eye for the Straight Guy" review of the inauguration. :p   Never mind the expense, the protests, the rather scary IMHO precendent Bush has set in terms of the inauguration, let alone his foreign policy, let's talk about Laura Bush's outfit. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy
It is impossible to read something that can't be found.
Well Duh!   The answer has ALWAYS BEEN Drugs, and Drug Traffickers. Concentrate on them and you have the answer to the problems!
How uninteresting must that be for you to intentionally spend time annoying people on the internet?
NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!
Dear smiling, friendly, forgiving Archangel:  I would be quite happy to respond to you if you could organize your incoherent mental states into logical, debatable points. Please refer to Chester's Questions for Bible-thumpers for guidelines.  As for staying on topic: since there is no God, it is rather pointless to have religious ceremonies in any case, isn't it?  As for my nom de Web, you have missed the point altogether. Either you are not quick on the uptake and/or you are completely ignorant of the Japanese language. Hint: surely you have seen the starry emblem on all Subaru cars?  To end on a conciliatory note: I entirely agree with the last sentence of your posting [except the punctuation].  -
If you had a look at all of the other threads on this topic you would see that.
3101 posts! what a waste of cyber real estate! at least you are brief.
78.4 years? Well excuse me but I intend to live much longer than that. I was thinking about 112.7 years. Yeah. That's about right.
Again, key word "genetic". My hair has the genetic characteristics of a human, but that doesn't make getting a haircut murder does it?  
Looks like someone couldn't grip with the fact that he was a closest racist. emoticonXCry
And you offer none for your's. Heteros engage is risky business as well. Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage.   It's not just STD's, it's all sorts of physical issues as well. Cancers, hepatitus, bacterial infections, that result from anal and vagina sex. Add one word and BAM, it works aganist you.
You have conviced no one or even come remotely to forming an argument.
So you're a perfect clone of one your parents with zero copying errors? Amazing.
what other forest? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world, and it would be what, the size on central park?
That's ok, cause it's completely legal to light up a cigarette while driving. I guess some feel that must be a lot safer than using a phone.

Oh Blah! Blah! Blah!  What the devil do Comanches know?  The sisterhood and brotherhood of Sioux, Navajo, Iroquois and other sundry tribes.
You know, its those happy-smiley cartoons that really freak me out. Is this just me or does anyone else find them creepy?
Oh? And what is the specific amount of pot you have to smoke before you become a drug crazed fiend?
It's a lot easier to kill someone with a gun than a cigarette or a beer.
And we have an emotional post with no substance whatsoever. I'm sure your twin will be checking in soon. I think I'll keep a count of this type of post.
What's that? Campaigning and use of taxpayer funded facilities like transportation for political purposes? I suppose they paid the cops for going out of their jurisdiction too?
You can try and deny the facts all you like. Here they are from the CDC for 2003, go spin them.
And of course, the theory of gravity isn't "physically" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the "Out of Africa" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense.
so your saying he was 200% god-man? i'm not a mathematician but that can't be right surley.

Now settle down charlie, and try to think rationally, just for a second. Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does? I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's.
And I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.
So your answer to the question then is "Nothing", Marc?
PROJECTION, again.... I'm amazed you can't recognise the amount you do it....
So did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words? You are the first mind reader I have encountered here. And considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science. According to you all science should be terrible. Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful?
The tooth fairy has a different function than the Easter bunny.

Yippie doo! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view. And his point of view has (or had) merit. But since then, several feathered dinosaurs (not birds) have been found. It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation. (You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a "point mutation" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation.
Not true. I googled "helpful mutation" and got a nice list of examples. I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions.
Your god sees no degree of sins. Shaving your beard, baby-rape, etc, are all punishable by death. That is, unless you repent. emoticonXBanghead

Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?

Well I am polishing my grave dancing shoes as these people in their 70's can not live forever.
what about God? So many God-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :)  seriously I really don't know much about terrorists. I know that Bin Laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it.

Actually in terms of populations we're the same people as the Irish. If you want tyranny try the oppression of the Native Americans. Did you know that the Natives and the blacks were both on the British side during the War of Independence? Amazing how we tyrants command such free support huh....
No, you can go on the public dole and have the rest of us hard-working Americans wipe your arse for you or you can buy your own or be fined for not doing so.  
So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?
It's ironic that you should talk about lack of evidence. At least we have a source to believe.
Why would I worry about a book of myths and fairy tales?
Amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term "light year."   If I am so ignorant, explain how your argument does not require exactly what I said: That God operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young Earth Creationism.   I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar.   
Gee right on schedule here's the other half of the comic relief. Get a job and a life and off the dole. PS I think mum would be happy to see you out of her basement too.
Where is the government in this? Clinicians made a clinical decision, and hid behind a non-mandatory guideline, which was set by other more senior clinicians, expert in their field. Assuming the woman's very detailed recall of the stressful series of events is accurate, perhaps it was God's way of telling this unmarried mother that after five previous miscarriages, she still wasn't getting the message.

Without more information I can give an exact date, but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984, he must have said that at least 21 years ago (and if he said it in the middle of his life/career, it would have been more like 60 years ago!) - he did not know back then what we now know.
Within one post.   Thanks for proving that creationist are incapable of discussing the original topic and automatically move to change the subject.

So, if having children isn't a requirement fro marriage, then gays should be OK, right?   If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?   If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?   You are confusing me. Please explain.
Well....it was easier to get them to use those rather than the ones that just said "White trash onboard".......
Just to be pedantic, a better analogy would be: "If you are here, why do you have brothers and sisters?"
So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized "Good morning, sweetie", that would be an answer?
Was your pretty graph supposed to convince me that the universe can't be understood? Perhaps I was to intuitively understand that you're right :p
More heretical misinformation from dear old cap0.   'Zionism is Racism' - a Dead Issue
That's it? That was your post? To attack a source without anything backing you up? Bravo!
Try and comprehend this child, your siggy is your OPINION. It is evidence of nothing real or imagined. Only in your mind does it prove anything at all.  
But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?
Because the soundbite "survival of the fittest" was coined to explain evolution to the stupid masses.
Well if you are Catholic you would should probably find him pretty credible.
let's have an up or down vote on your marriage rights too Lurch.....
And irrational emotional appeals seldom hold up in the face of logic
oh cc, apparently, 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow. We can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone, we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad ( although, I have her beat by 4 years and counting, still happy and going) We have the power. We are gay, ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say (ask jaaman for more info)
Yes yes yes. We know you are bigoted against any non-christian. I am sure that the out of context quotes are totally misrepresenting Islam. But, your out of context quotes totally misrepresent Judaism too.. so that is no surprise.
It's sophomoric remarks like that that hurt the gay cause in America.   God isn't mocked, though. And I doubt the people are either.   And I'm glad California outlawed the sin. The only thing you have left is to hope the far left, spiritually-stunted judges in the US Supreme Court are pro Sodom and Gomorrah.

Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?
I find it funny you think Article V was repealed yet the bill of rights references Article V for passage.   So we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but Article V which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? You've really lost it haven't you.  
Has the American Medical Association decided to recognize that aluminum, steel and polymer and addictive narcotic substances that can drastically alter a person's mental status?
Observations? Like the posts I have made? Which would be documented via quotes?....emoticonXConfused You demanded 'links' for your recurring rudeness, I produced them. I demand 'links' for my creationism.
It's also hard to convince a rational person that something is so if there is zero evidence of its truth, but then you wouldn't have any clue about that.
I think we should not only allow GAYs to have legal marriage rights but also those who want to practice insist as well as all who want to practice polygamy. Let us not stop there let us sanction union between human and animals. After all I love my Dog and my Parrot. Why stop with GAYs?   By the way where does the term GAY come from for homosexuals.
Are you going to go and urinate on his grave as well?  My! My! What hatred and vitriol! What does it feel like to have so black a heart?

Wow Archie, way to suck the fun out of something. Let me use your words here:  
Alexander, I don't give a rat's rectum about King James. emoticonXBanghead
No, actually, we don't.   I suppose it's pointless to ask someone who would speak for God to not tell me what I know.
O.K. lets' play your game. Gun control has worked exactly WHERE?
I don't understand your outrage. McChrystal's your boy's general now. Are you saying that you disagree with "the Great One"?
It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?
Plenty. You haven't noticed how many "sentences" you post that aren't sentences?  
Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental, nebulas natural selection, or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric.
The egg is now a conscious human? In under 72-hours? Wow.
You actually posted something that made good sense, and was funny too, maybe there hope for you yet.
point me toward the right way then? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs. please tell us how creationists were wrong. i would gladly like to see you try!
And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.
John/John would figure out a way for the American taxpayers to foot the bill.
You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime?? wow, sounds like a liberal to me..
Did you even notice that they were not the first to report it? Oh wait, you didn't because you are obviously using the fallacy of selective observation.  
All the more reason to be armed to the teeth huh,does this mean you see it our way?
No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure.
And Anarchy. Am I allowed to kill someone if I feel like it ?
Sounds like an abortion bill amendment to restrict all travel by minors is needed by those demanding that young girls give birth after being impregnated by rapists, fathers, uncles, etc. Might as well include adults, just to simplify matters and enhance state police power. Bubbah will be pleased.
For someone that knows how each side thinks, I would have thought you would have had an eye opening response that would have had me recanting everything I have said in the past and glorifying your name and everything you would say in the future, BUT, instead I got   
  Now that is a diaper load. How's that free speech thing doing up there by the way.
I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.
Ahhh I see so God was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor. Like how Sodom and Gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor.  
I guess the European union is a great failure? Is that why the Euro is trending 1.5 dollars as liberalism creats misery?
So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing? What's this world coming too? LOL
I was eight at the time. I'll read up and get back to you. Mind your manners.
Hmm.. does that include the Muslim Communities you were associated with too?.. We know as rational people that Denial is the Christians best weapon. You should seriously consider increasing your medications..   
Yes but your one of those Christians people hear about, but never find. You don't really exist. :)
so you are into pommy bashing now? mae honey, is there anybody you don't like? emoticonXRolleyes
So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.

Well, the pill has the ability to not let it implant, which "God" already cause for around 60% of its contemporaries. The pill doesn't destroy the "entity" at all.
Oh.. that makes sense. Because, it sounds exactly like modern day republicans.
But apparently they can't say no to renting the property for a gay wedding, even if they decide to just say 'no' to everyone and get out of business. go figure

Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?  Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.
So everything that other people say on a website or in a book is just and opinion? And everything you say is a fact? Nice how you've got things set up.
It's also a noun. But since you're unable but to repeat your self, maybe a few more times will make it 'true'
Good lesson! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions. Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you...you should just casually drive away. Thanks Simone!
Really? Can you link to a creationist website that does not connect evolution to people doing bad things?
And that would make you the one that IS advocating the murder of our future generation.
No you don't cede that decision to her, Steeeve, you want to butt into her personal life and make her decision for her.
Ready to condemn blind faith yet, jyoshu? Or are you going to stick to the argument that blind faith is fine so long as you can see you're not doing harm?
Umm, don't know about you but I also eject waste through my penis - just don't do it when having sex, just not polite (unless they ask, now there's another fetish I don't get). Isn't it odd if the anus was not designed for a penis its still pleasurable?  
Hey don't insult Olberman... he looks good on the tube emoticonXGood lol....

Dear god.You really haven't a clue about what your talking about.Away with the birdies i think.Yousef was responsible for the 93 bombing,and he himself had very broad associations with some of the Al-Qaeda hardcore(Osama said he didn't know him and was in Sudan while Yousef stayed in Peshewer).Osama wasn't responsible for the 93 bombing,he wasn't responsible for Bali and Madrid and i don't care what the world media tells you.But by all means keep spouting your misinformation,i for one find it hilarious.  The Yousef-Osama-Saddam link is a conspiracy theory.
And I didn't. Did you note how I explicitly put [Jesus said] for the first two quotes from the Bible, but not for the third one? Any idea why? Come on, think ... you can do it!

Well, the antichrist is going to come and make any true believer a heretic any way so what am I worried about? I knew the risks before I accept the job. :-)
What prompted this?  I guess I need to check what website I'm in...  Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. But, I've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.  But, carry on, Orion.

So you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? That someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? What if it where your nipples? After all nipples on men serve no purpose.
I'm with Smiley: you're describing yourself perfectly, save for referring to conservatives instead of liberals.
That's deep.  Movement is not matter, I will use that the next time I decide to babble.  Are the particles no longer matter when there moving ?  Your funny.

Of course it's solely a product of women's behavior simone. It's the women that has to make the phone call to the stork. The stork doesn't answer calls from men.

My thoughts are my own, not from some 2000 year old Book that makes as much sense as a bag of Rocks. And I have only ever called anyone a name in response to an attack on me,   If you call what you have been doing debating then I see what the problem really is.
It might be telling that super heroes typically don't use firearms. That I'd prefer my crowds to have few if any guns concealed within hardly makes me pro-crime. Nor does it make me a pacifist. I'm a big fan of violence. The hands on kind.
Name them. Real contemporary people who testified about a real superman. And don't forget to identify the time period and where they lived and their written historical accounts.

Oh he won't read that... This American in exile (does not even live here anymore) just disappears for a while whe the heat is on only to resurface with his same propaganda after the heat has died down.

So then will you go the way on liberty (repeal stoopid laws) or tyranny (enact more unconstitutional laws)?
Archie, you have said so many incorrect things about evolution on this thread that it's hard to know where to begin. The idea that 'evolution teaches essentially that a fish walked out of the ocean and survived long enough to become a mammal 'springs readily to mind.  
Waxy:  Why are you standing by saying nothing while one of your own is continuing to show how ignorant he is by asserting Isochron was not used at KBS Tuff ?  Ray M.
What the freaking hell are you even talking about, dude? Hi its Me did not even post that. Do you even read the dang posts here before spouting off your drivel!? Not to mention that it proved the unintelligence of creationists (as well as their predictive abilities, which, I must say are very poor).
Crammed with them, sure, why not? It's easy, only a few million light years. The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too.
Well, it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution. One doesn't expect Creationists to possess it.
And because this man said it, it must be true? A simple appeal to authority.
People make mistakes (excepting some pro-evolutionists who respond with anger and blame others of 'twisting their words'.)
Oh damn it...and I was going to sell this joke and retire!

You forgot about the youth recruitment efforts as well. I am president of the local chapter of "Get 'Em While They're Young."

No, we don't claim to know the truth. We gladly say "we don't know" to questions like "why are we here" instead of making up fairy tale answers just because we're too impatient to look for the truth. Tell us, do you still believe in the fire god and the tooth fairy too?

Examined the record? Now it's not even the patient, just the record? Good god man! Many times, only a number of criteria must be met, not all of them. It would be like me saying that there must be gas in your car since it is running. Then you tell me that I must look at the gauge then physically take the tank off to be able to say without a doubt there is gas in it. Flat EEG in the cerebral cortex means no brain activity in cerebral cortex means PVS. There is no reason to test a swallowing reflex, a pain response reflex, or sphincter tone.

So what are you proposing? Death panels? Do you think we should euthanase the elderly or should we simply stop their social security payments and healthcare?
Unfortunately for you, that is not shown, the evidence points in one direction, and one direction only. That of evolution and to the fact that the flood never happened.
You're right, why not simply kill these people in the shortest amount of time possible. I got it! We can advertise each killing (hanging, rock slaying, Guillotine, etc.) weeks in advance, kinda like moves, and show it on pay-per-view. You can buy tickets to watch the show live as well. I mean c'mon, if we're going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome, cost efficient, and swift method possible. Right? That is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago.   Honestly, how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders. In regards to the death penalty debate, it falls along a continuum between morality and scientific reasoning.
Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not? Well, alledgedly, 23 innocent people have been put to death, and for sure two unrefutable cases. I don't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system.
According to Genesis? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence? How about Darwin's On the Origin of the Species?
Insects are not birds. Get your terminology correct. Also please stop lying. It makes baby jesus cry.   
  How do you KNOW Bush let's Cheney run the government..oh yeah, that's right, CNN/CBS told you. So you will knock one of the greatest minds this country has because he has a bad heart and can't stand for long periods of time? What a goober, so I guess Stephen Hawking should die too, huh?  
god, this has been argued against a thousand times. by this deffinition masterbation is killing, menstration is involentary manslauter. by this deffinition you kill someone every time you walk by a carrot without eating it.
Well, I guess you can refuse to see something that's pretty obvious. It's up to you.
Yep, but those "mixed views" are slanted way left of center. A good offense always beats a good defense :) My guess is you are not very mature nor old? You out of high school yet?

NAAAAA, actually it makes ME sound quite sane...I'm not denying a woman the "right" to have sex all she wants. THere ARE ways of having sex WITHOUT getting pregnant, I'm sure you'd agree.

Well, if you want to tell the truth, the theory of evolution is NOT a religion, it involves no magical deities, it takes nothing on faith. And since creation involves supernatural forces that are supported by absolutely NO evidence, it is not a scientific theory.

In fact, the word isn't found in any popular dictionary what so ever. It's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all. I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever. But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY: Urban Dictionary: omnibenevolent Once again guys, get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you haven't an actual clue about.
Tell ya what; I got this Rolex I'm wiling to sell ya for $50.00. Give me the money and wait here. I'll be right back!
So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed?
You're living in an absolute naive dream world about this guy. I think I should be trying to sell YOU the beachfront property.
Better a godly set of morals being crammed down your throats than the perverted gay sex hedonism of the devil himself.
i take by your redundant posts that you havent read the previous 20..
Having politicians monitor their ethics is much like having the mafia monitor crime.   
This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)
Just like Obama is? Really? Have you researched it at all?   
Exactly, they are big on condeming the sins of those other guys. It makes them feel better about themselves. Also, it is always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homos are not going to disappear, abortion will never be made illegal. That's how the religious right recruits folks - get 'em all indignant about the "others" and they never notice they are being fleeced by the fat little pastor.
I see -- in your opinion is it is "illegitimate", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance.
If you'd have taken the time to watch the movie "Expelled" you wouldn't find it nearly so absurd. emoticonXAngel
Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.  
So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.
You still trying to push your propaganda film? Let me ask you something, why would the fetus try and avoid the forceps? An infant will cheerfully try and grip a knife that is about to end it's life.
Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata.
So you'd ask on these issues even if you didn't know if they had signed it?
Don't get your panties in a wad, 38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control this clown can dream up.
That should get the natives milling around looking for victims. Fundamentalist Christianity does not take kindly to criticism.
This rates an 8 out of 10 on the hypocracy scale. Weren't you just scolding people both for using false analogies and for citing emotionally laden imagery for political purposes? Tsk tsk.
who knew? I wonder if I could have passed all those philosophy tests based on the philosophy I absorbed?  
What exactly are the age ranges of these "children" in the news stories?
Hey that would be great. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners of military service age and ability to own a fully automatic rifle. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners to train with the weapon. The law would FORCE VOR to keep his rifle clean. Hey VOR how about it? Keep your rifle clean or go to jail. I'm not talking about my rifle, I'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean. How about you?
There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value.
And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO just because I stated that some presidents....cough.... Clinton.......don't get experience in one term doesn't
That's a Damascene conversion if ever there was one! Archie's seen the light!
This should be in the science section, not the CvE section. Don't give SS any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology.
yea you've rebuttled every one of my posts with rhetoric. How do you explain how The Computational and Analytical Molecular Evolution Laboratory is calling for a new synthesis based on "biased" mutations??????   let's hear it.
oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.
So, am I looking for attention or am I mentally ill?
you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise.
When 90 percent of this forum is left wing out of work Liberals it is not a surprise that polls don't go the Conservative way.........
Since you seem to know Jebus so well why don't you ask him to make an appearance and tell all of us heathens the error of our ways.. Why not let Jebus tell the world what he thinks about Homosexuals ... Oh wait.. Jebus never mentioned the subject so this is just YOU and YOUR ilk spreading more homophobic paranoia ...   You've reached a new Low EZridden.. and I never thought you could get any lower ...emoticonXBounceremoticonXBouncer
I have never, and will never stand for reasonable gin control laws. After all, I hate vodka martini's.
Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste.
Are you blind, or can't you read? NATO just provided evidence right now.  
You resort to the Bible, just in whatever way is convenient to what you want it to say. Just like fundies do. Zardoz, the problem is that when you play devil's advocate (which you like to do), you ONLY take a fundie approach toward the scriptures. In fact, you're often more fundamentalist in the way you approach scripture than fundamentalists. You'd make a good fundie, the best of them, I suppose.
So you think that ID is actually Christanity?   [quote]But in usual fashion you will claim it is me who doesn't understand when it is you who must corrupt the truth with the lies and distortions you tell.
Funny. Foreigners are always cited when liberals talk about how great gun control is and how much good can come from it.
