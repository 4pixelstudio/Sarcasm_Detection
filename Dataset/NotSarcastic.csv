Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code (e.g. intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle), the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code (global optimum of the system)?   Articles 5-7   These articles discuss fascinating mathematical representation of the genetic code. For example, in article 6 a representation of the genetic code as a six–dimensional Boolean hypercube is proposed.   Abstract:
President Obama has correctly characterized the Bill of Rights is a list of negative Rights against government.   The point is, that the only rights that the government, and or any anti-gunner, or department has, is the infringements we grant them through laws etc.   Taking the info in this article at face value. What was a legal practice to do just yesterday landed this guy in a jackpot for not knowing what or how the Govt. is going to interpret the law to mean today. This is a common problem with, and not to directly pick on the ATF, but gun dealers complain about this all the time. EVEN an FBI agent himself cannot predict, nor curry a favorable interpretation.   What kind of country and legal system do we want? Surely you can see that this kind of stuff is not in ANY WAY Shape of Form, fair to do to a Right that our Constitution says is Inalienable. Or to a person who was an impeccable reputation.   Would you like to be treated in this manner?   The article says, what he did is not illegal, but in the hands of someone with an axe to grind, maybe they didn't like him, or maybe the prosecutor is Anti-gun etc, lands this guy in a jackpot!   Now can you see the problem with this?   I know lets apply all of this to computers! We will just make up any law as we go. How'd that be?
When talking to a person professing Christianity, the Bible is binding. If the Bible advises that abortion is murder, then it is so regardless of what the secular systems of the day have to say about it.   When talking with one accepting the principles of Christianity, the premiere of those being that the Bible is binding, the existence of the soul is not up for debate.   The position of Bassman, I believe, would be that there is no legitimate right to terminate a pregnancy, especially from the stand-point of the Bible, which of course, is binding to those professing Christianity.
Good idea!
No, they do not. I know several people in England who posess weapons the bought on the street. How are the gun laws in england working when you can buy a machine gun?   Before the ban, england had lower numbers when it came to firearms related deaths. They also had lower crime numbers. The sociological differences between England and the United States are not be be discounted.   It is interesting to note that crime rates in England seem to be rising now that the gun ban has been around for a while. There is even a movement by public officials to arm police officers in response to the rising rate of violent crime. There isa n article and debate about it right here on the forums.   The biggest difference lately in the statistics in England in the US is not the numbers, it is how they are recorded. If a guy is confronted by three people outside a bar and shot to death, but the gus get off during trial, it is still recorded in America s a three person homocide. In england, it is NOT recorded. I get the London Times, and they have done several articles accusing th British government of manipulating crime figures. I think that if we in America only recorded solved crimes in our crime statistics, we might become one of the most cime free contries in the world!
Well, the claim isn't that they were identical, just that they preceded Jesus and were very similar.
So what we have here is a lie, based on a distortion, which is itself a fallback position from a fallback position from a fallback position from an evidence-free made-up graph about the magnetic age of the earth. And creationists say the truth is constant...
No Ted Kennedy is not a fundie but Vitter is. For God sake the pope is a nazi and a fundie.   Marlene Elwell, the nazi *itch, who put the evil mariage amendment on the michigan ballot is a Roman Catholic also. If you are a christian and you believe in the suppression of homosexuality then you are a fundie and a christianist.
The question is illogical. By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible. See another thread for that topic.   The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature. To state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.
And an even funnier thing is it won't affect his wallet at all.
And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?
No. You're missing the point. Al wants you to think all we have to do is stop emitting CO2. He wants you to fear something that he knows how to fix...so you'll give him prizes for being a genius and solving the problem.   Al Gore is a shyster...just like Michael Moore. Documentary, my XXX!   Tell me, what has caused the global warming on Mars?...Jupiter? I understand the temperatures there have been rising more in the past few years than before. Think it could be resulting from their industrial age?   ...and he's pretty much a hypocrit about what we should do. Check the stats on his personal home. Check the emissions rating of his antique private jet. He claims to be doing his part by leading a carbon neutral life...which means he merely paid for permission to continue polluting the earth with his inefficient means of private transportation and his energy sucking home.   He claims that sea levels will rise 20 feet or so shortly, yet he bought a million dollar condo near sea level in California.   We should all decrease what we spew into the air (and what we send to landfills). This fact does not diminish the lies told by Al Gore...the ones that got him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, both of which become more meaningless each year.

My recollection is similar to yours. I encountered it in an AP biology class in high school, we spent about 1/2 the extra-long class in labs (I think that was the primary difference).   The giraffe example was an "aha" moment for me personally, I suspected life changed, but the specifics I had never thought about.   I recall a disclaimer at the start of the section, but I don't recall the exact wording.   -Mach
You are getting to a more complicated area where "mental existence" no longer matters. I've explained earlier that it isn't exactly the same as "self defense" so I don't think a similiar response is needed. Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.   At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before.
But only if they're willing to receive one. Most aren't.
i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular english   and yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a "possibility of existence". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: "greatest possible being". the "greatest possible being", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole "proof" is pointless because your premise is already the proof   just keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as "the greatest being possible". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...   does that mean that God exists? hmmm....
you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing
This makes more sense then anything else I've heard on this thread.
I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.
Yes, they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods. You're an atheist, aren't you?
This also applies to tapeworms. I fail to see how it is therefore relevent to any debate on abortion.
So, your saying an eyewitness would mean nothing. Yeah right.
Well, not completely, but yes, quite the same. However, this is irrelivent- she wasn't a person, because she was in a coma. Does that give me the right to kill her? Of course not!   What about fetuses born in comas? Can we kill them?   What about people in vegetative states? After all, they arn't perfect, so let's kill them!
Oh. You just lost me. The fact is, Jesus warned his followers that they would be persecuted for his sake. Read Matthew 10:5-42, if you care for the full text. Basically he told them they would be beaten, thrown in prison, crucified, and put to death if they followed him. And that is exactly what happened to the disciples and all those who gave a witness for Christ as Lord and Savior.   The various Roman emperors in those years of the early church sought to kill every Christian they could find, men, women, and children. Christians were crucified by the thousands, covered in pitch, and sit afire to provide light for the emporer's lavish garden parties. They were killed in the arena by wild animals and tortured to death in numerous ways. They were called martyrs, which now means one who dies for a cause. The word is Greek and means “witness”. These witnesses for Christ were killed for their faith. How many Christians would we have today if they had to die for their faith? In spite of everything that the emperor did, they could not kill the Christians fast enough. More were believing in Christ every day, and eventually even the Roman emperor himself became a Christian and Christianity was embraced and sanctioned.
So he failed to follow procedure? So was one of the procedures to assist the child in holding the gun while the gun was being fired and to not stand at a distance? If that's the case then the instructor at the firing range was also partially at fault because it was also his responsibility to supervise the child. And I just found this:   "SPRINGFIELD, Mass. - Authorities in Massachusetts are considering whether criminal charges should be filed in the death of an eight-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself with an Uzi submachine-gun at a gun show.   "Hampden County District Attorney William Bennett says he hasn't been able to find any law that would authorize a child to possess or fire a machine-gun."   Criminal charges possible in boy's Uzi death, Massachusetts authorities say - Yahoo! Canada News   So not only is allowing children to fire machines guns irresponsible it may also be illegal.
Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves.
Excellent point Doc
The definition of manslaughter is when one's actions, which end up killing someone, display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation. That's not a proper legal definition, but it'll do.   Now, you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter, and thus their position is ridiculous. I'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter, and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for.   I'm not saying "miscarriage is not manslaughter," but only "miscarriage is not always manslaughter." For example, if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous, but had a miscarriage anyway, she would obviously not have committed manslaughter. If a woman had one drink with dinner, but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died, then she would not have committed manslaughter, because that was not reckless. I pointed out the "you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex" argument as a position somebody might hold, but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter.   So obviously, miscarriage cannot be manslaughter in the sense of "every instance of A is an instance of B."
Technically, all syllogisms need two premises, first of all.   "Step two" and "step three" were a dilemma, not separate steps. Learn to read.   Dilemma:   You only read Scenario 1, which was:   step two -God can create a rock he cannot lift -   Step three - God cannot lift the rock   conclusion - God is not all powerful   Scenario Two was   - God cannot create such a rock   - Therefore, there is something God cannot do   - Therefore, God is not all-powerful   The only case in which God could truly be all-powerful is if he can somehow both create an unbreakable rock and then break it, which defies the Law of Non Contradiction and is thus absurd. Thus, the notion of all-powerfulness, which leads to such a notion, is also absurd.
So what's the deal when GWB "gives" $3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $6,000, the family can't make up the difference and the $3,000 goes unspent. All we've accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury. You think it's a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it? You're thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus.
Yes, every living thing is made up of cells.
We agree!   Excellent!
If your friend is hearing voices in her head to walk into traffic, she needs some psychiatric help.
You pointed out someone that had 6 fingers.   I said that making a copy is not creating anything new, I never mentioned anything about reproduction.
Can't argue with this illogic.
Well, I would agree that as many constitutional ammendments probably would not have passed, but I certainly don't think they all would not have been passed, and I don't think that Massachusettes allowing same-sex marriage was a bad thing. Constitutional ammendments are difficult to overcome, but no one can ever change a law if people aren't willing to take a stand and fight for it.   Can you tell that I love the quote in Jyoshu's signature?
Actually it wouldn't. Since there is no rational, believable evidence for creationism, it wouldn't be any more believable if evolution were disproved. As an example, I dare you to start a thread in an appropriate forum and give us tested evidence for a global flood as depicted in Genesis. Good luck.
Well, how else were they supposed to reproduce?
Well if you just shoot someone and they die then they dont get their day in court so they dont get due process. The fifth says you cant lose your life without due process.
Purposefully communicating information as a means to an end... wound healing.
The subject matter would be life forms. The units would depend on which particular aspect you were studying   For instance to the question 'what units of measurement would you use for the effect of evolution?   I would say genetic changes that have patterns.   ID would have that and more.
Said the troll that lives in the UK
Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers? That's a statement of faith.
I may be a pro-gunner but what doe's that have to do with with gay rights?   Since I'm a pro- gunner I won't force my life style or views on you,if you don't force yours on me.Deal?   After all you seem to be the expert on gay rights.
Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.
A person going to Hell is a consequence of sin. God doesn't want it, but he can't stop it.
I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting.
actually they probably drifted much faster than that.....probably upon a pole reversal.
and section 6
After what the Fins been through, fighting the mother country, the Soviet Union under Lenin and then Russia and Germany and finally Germany, I doubt they are going to let their own government take away their guns??   Most folks have learned to leave those Finns alone.
The Brady Campaign whines more than they act. Making handguns legal in Chicago wouldn't make them happy. Sending the national guard in wouldn't make them happy. They don't have a solution for the problem, but they're right there to whine about it.   They're just like the Federal Government; they find something simple and complicate it.
Define "many". What you really mean one is too much. Even when the one is used soles for personal defense. Besides your in Austraila, no one cares what you think.
In point of fact, the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion, but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it. See this study, for instance:   http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB...heet/fsest.htm   People have small families because they want small families. In point of fact, the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US, due, again, to education and contraception.   Would you force folks to have children they don't want?
Unions fought to keep children out of work for the same reason they fought to keep blacks and women out of work - they want a monopoly on employment.
I don't have the time nor the funding to put this in video form like Harris and Dawkins. I don't think many, if any, Christians really do - satire about atheism isn't a strong Christian practice, not nearly as strong as atheist satire about Christianity, it seems. Maybe that's what made Poe's Law so notable in the beginning of this thread.
Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc...
It is horribly oppressive of women, though, to oppose both abortion and contraceptives. That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all.
It depends on the particular situation. Some adoption agencies ask about it, and some don't. Most social workers who do home studies are aware that they have gay clients doing adoptions. Some adoptive gay parents are out about it, and some keep it quiet.   There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, "I am not homosexual." Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely. They have also instituted a weight requirement for all adoptive parents. In the case of a couple, their combined weight has to be below a certain figure or they are not allowed to adopt. No fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most Americans.
yes, but adam wasnt created with hereditary information or from sperm and egg cells. adam was the prototype. any subsequent humans should be born following the fashion in which adam was made. otherwise adam could have been shaped like a goat and still bear human children, because god could have formed him into whatever shape or lack of shape he wanted, yet put the genetic information in him to produce human offspring. why should adam's children look like adam? wouldnt adam's children be born the way adam was created, or not?
And your analysis is flat out lacking. What everyone else seems to realize is that the reason Obama won is because of FAR higher turnout, many by African American voters. (Who more tend to be ... taa daa! ... Democrats!) There is definitely a considerable discrepancy in Obama supporters and gay marriage supporters. Of that, there can be no doubt.   And your anaysis of the FL situation is completely removed from reality. FL requires a vote of over 60% for an amendment to pass. It wouldn't pass at 59%, let alone 50. So not only do you demonstrate a lack of even knowing what was needed there, it doesn't even fit as an apt comparison.
I think you present a good point, but part of the test here is to see how my post is reponded to; silence from certain people tells us things in inself.   So far it seems my initial estimation of the issue is about right- the idelogy being upheld helps some people ignore the effect the punitive policy imposes.
A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S.
And here our Government says:   Rights and Responsibilities
So sorry; I have a friend who works and lives in the D.C. area, but he has residency in Mass., because he owns a home there. And he was able to be married only because he owns a home there ?
thatisnt stupid, its what teh bible says. teh dinosaurs are heavier thatn humans so they sunk and humans foated. the arc protecid the rest ans they died later when humans kiled them tehy still see dinos today in congo so some survivd.
Well, I suppose that the reply it took me almost 5 minutes to type, a couple more to check and a couple to correct will not suffice now.
Why is that propoganda? It's exactly what you do.
Well, given that your term is a fabrication of the creationist's mind, I suppose you're right. Evolutionists don't actually exist. Therefore you could assign whatever traits you wanted to them, including dishonesty. Evolutionist is a term designed to cast evolution as a faith based notion. The problem is there is no faith in evolution, faith is a belief in something with no proof. Evolution has proof. Therefore it cannot be a faith based idea. A typical creationist attack is to misrepresent their target by creating a strawman of it. They then declare it is wrong and by proxy, the actual theory wrong. It's fundementally weak, but inline with a belief that is scientifically unsound.
Actually, not at all true. The organisms of the Cambrian look little like modern animals. It is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics. For example, the cordates first arise in the early Cambrian, along with primitive inverebrates. You can safely say that no animal living today looks much like any living then. For example, there were no amphibians, no reptiles, no insects, no birds, and of course, no mammals.   Your shotgun approach isn't actually worth answering in any detail. It isn't even your work.
And how is your think group any different, you all think alike just as gun owners all think alike. So stop calling the kettle black.
You mean to tell me it's a falsehood??   I don't believe it.
Let's not confuse our readers. supersport is not saying it's evolution; he's saying that "evolutionists" say that it's evolution. It should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity.
No I don't think that tying your tubes is abortion. I only think abortion comes into play when there is actually cells forming to make a baby, and you get them scraped out, or abort a baby before or after the third trimester. Plus I heard that if you tie the tubes, when you decide you want a baby you can untie the tubes, to conceive a baby. But burning is another thing. But unless there is actual cells forming it is not abortion
Same thing happened in Rwanda. First they put the names of all Tutsis on lists. Then, the Hutu came around with machettes and took them off of the lists....permanently.
Then there's that state thaht wants to remove the use of BC and AD from the calendar. I guess they'll change it to some neutral like plus and minus numbers just to stay with the rest of the world....or maybe 2005 will change to 133,956,373,278.
There's absolutely no way in hell this could be legal in any sense. That California school got ***** slapped for expelling a student who had a gun off campus, beyond the jurisdictional reach of the school. So how can this school believe they can get away with such an insane policy?
Thank God. I too hope it doesn't keep going back and forth. While I live across the river in Parkville, Missouri, I used to live in Overland Park Kansas and went to school there. I think they are generally pretty good public schools, it's just the state school board that keeps effing everything up when they get some christonazis on board.
One day you're going to realize that you're evangelizing" and "witnessing" have pushed far more people away from religion then has brought them in."   "You're not telling people about God, you're guilting them and putting them down. You're drawing an imaginary line that separates "us" from "them", and you're cutting yourself off from other people. When Jesus "evangelized" (I believe with all my heart he would hate that word), he made honest friends, not with the purpose to "convert" them. He didn't hand them a track and scare them into being a Christian. No wonder people hate Christians, for God's sake I'm starting to hate Christians."   Maybe you should follow your own advice...   jim:   Yes, God loves Saddam but He hates the way he is acting.
You're working at the wrong end of the problem. We need young to survive. It's the old that are expendable.
The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the "quality of life" test.
A soul has a consciences, it can be emotionally moved from different states of being. This is how the Bible can say ones soul is moved; saddened; joyous. Etc.   I think therefore I am. Meaning a soul is emotional and so it really has no body. The soul is what we ask the Lord to preserve.   1Peter 1[9] Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.   Hamburger does not have a soul, it is dead meat. People eat brains and all the pieces of an animal. No soul. The soul is consciences. Under some conditions it can return, not after death or before a brain though. We know that to be impossible. Fetuses do not get emotional; there is no mind to speak of. No soul there to trouble.   If you?re on a machine and a doctor determines your brain is dead, the soul is not there. The body could see hell or heaven and there is no emotional effect. No soul for that.   Read the Bible. Don?t listen to fools; you?re a person with a soul. Use it.
So even though you can legally conceal carry right up to the gate of the national parks, and you can legally hunt within the parks, somehow concealed carry in the parks will become more dangerous?
That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.   Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress.
So why should merchant ships be required to go unarmed and defenseless in dangerous areas?
It is worse then that they just don't get it. Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority. They just don't get it.
And she was having unprotected sex? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility? Yeah, I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers.
OK try the US Constitution. We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation. Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited. Minorities continue to have rights which may not be infringed by the majority. Amibiguity and sharing of interests in various types of personal and social decisions is a necessary component of this system. We are built on compromise and that has served us well.
So, we are debating creation, yet you don't consider quoting the bible, the single most important original proponent of the creation account and to you, it doesn't qualify as a source for what is being discussed here? You say this and expect to be taken seriously?
State-level governments are largely worthless, in my opinion. It is complete absurdity to allow Constitutions to be ammended based on the vote of the people. People as a whole are largely biased, uninformed, and care only about the wellbeing of the majority, persecuting the minority any chance they get. Simply put, the will of the people is too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority, and this can be seen everywhere throughout history. The will of the people often deserves to be not only ignored but put in a little can and crushed, for the voice of the people is not the voice of the people at all; it is the voice of the majority.   I cannot know the intentions of the creators of the California goverment when they created their judicial system, but if it was anything like the intentions of the founders of our nation, then the judges are doing precisely what it was intended to do: judge laws which persecute the minority, assuring that the government cannot engage in such persecution without a whole lot of effort and not having to fear retaliation. If the point of judges was simply to give in to whatever pesecution 51% of the population wishes to force upon the other 49%, then our government would be tyrannical in no time.   You may feel that a bad precedent was set, but I consider it a far worse precedent for a judge to have given into the majority, to ignore what he feels is a destruction of freedom and equality, simply because it is popular to do so. I would also recommend that the California Constitution be judged based on the fact that it likely has conflicting statements, for example, it may state that everyone must recieve equal protection under the law, of which this is a clear denial.   The California judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the Federal Constitution; it would have to be taken to the Federal Courts for that.
Three questions:   What country operates under an "unbridled capitalism" system?   Can you name any nation that has operated under your idea of socialism successfully?   If the American system of government is so terrible, why do we have one of the highest standards of living on earth?   Just because you think you are entitled to what I earn doesn't make it so. Earn your own.
The fear of God? What God? Only yours or any God? How about the fear of something greater than yourself? Would that be progress?   I'm not trying to inform you or anyone else of anything at this time. I posted thread originally to get reactions to it so that I could better judge whether those views were valid or not. As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here, but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else. So don't think I'm trying to push anyone to believe anything, although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it. Based on the way you posted here, it is my guess you are unwilling to do that in the case presented here.
Actually they do. Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely. Did you not notice where the article came from? From a paper in India. I also found articles on the same subject from papers all over the country as well as in other countries such as Romania.   Save your snobbery for someone else.
Humans cannot cleanse themselves of their sins.
This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.   Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could "micro-evolve" from a few ancestral "kinds" on the ark.
I say that you need to take into consideration the number of criminals that'll disregard the lock and try and break down the door anyway. That's why smart people don't rely exclusively on locks and security systems for their own protection.
But you are smart enough to realize that the ban on gay marriage has nothing to do with it.
WOW simone, are you kidding me? You will use this story as an example of how dangerous giving birth is on this American forum by referring to a story from Sub Saharan Africa? And you consider this a rational argument? Here's another quote from your link: Fistulas are a scourge of the poor, affecting two million women and girls, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia   So tell us, PLEASE!!! How is this an argument which justifies abortions in America where Fistulas is virtually unknown as a result of child birth? Tell me how this quoted section below applies to any aspect of medical care in the USA.   The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers a corpse.   Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby&#8217;s skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.   One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.
No Archie I wouldn't dare do anything sexual outside of the missionary position without a ring on my finger... As far as superior or better umm no Archie. As a governor of a state he has to be for all peoples not just the ones that fund his campaign.. Unless of course the constitution is flawed and there's a tiny little clause excluding him from upholding all aspects of the document.   And once again YOUR god commanded Archie not America's god or every person on this planet. Don't you understand that there is a separation between church and state? Or did you throw that out the window too?   Oh and the state of Texas is making school children take a bible class. Doesn't matter if the kids an atheist or agnostic or doesn't believe in it or was raised differently their still making them read it.   Way to go Texas for overstepping the boundaries of church and state...   But no Archie I'm merely stating that this nut doesn't consider gays or lesbians equal peoples under the law where they need protection. Doesn't matter that I can pull up thousands of incidents of hate crimes due to a persons sexual orientation, doesn't matter that Gay and Lesbian teens are harassed up to the point of suicide let alone god forbid their allowed to even have rights.   Point being is a public official elected to serve and protect all peoples under the law for the common good has stated just to do the opposite..
First, I think you may have misunderstood the "pro-life mantra" seeing how many pro-lifers think it permissable to disconnect life-support systems in certain circumstances, which necessarily results in a person's death. But nevertheless, I think we agree that for purposes of the abortion discussion, it is a closer analogy to assume the violinst is only connected for nine months, and no longer than if we assume the violinist to be connected for some other arbitrary period of time. Am I correctly discerning an agreement on that?
So then women who are pregnant shouldn't be allowed to   1) Smoke   2) Take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child   3) Drink   or do any otherwise legal action?   And VOR takes another giant step towards fascism.
Actually, I meant the behaviour refered to in her post was interesting.
What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth? Have you no regard for them?
You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.
You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am "god" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase "How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - "Do unto others...". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.
I think that the type of weapon does make a difference. A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives.
And sometimes, necessary.
Contraceptives (for example a condom/ the pill) aren't going to last a month effectively. Then there's the fact that contraceptives, given the above data, can still be 99% effective, as it doesn't mention how many pregnancies they've prevented.   What does the writer make of this though? "According to this, condoms have a high failure rate for pregnancy."
the fetus would be a real person...and it seems like....in order to make the iraq war/abortion connection....you would have to support the war!
Not heard that before! made me laugh almost as much as your lettuce eating Tyrannosaur
So you have a scumbag democrat screeching hate speech and we are supposed to believe its true! Get real baby even you don't believe this unless you have donated a vital organ associated with reasoning.
Why is it when Creo's don't believe something, Evo's always think because they have studies or what have you that we Creo's have to accept it as proof. I mean you don't accept anything as proof from Creo's. If Creo's did some carbon testing and did it accurately and got some anomaly's, you'd still reject it. I didn't lie not even by ignorance. I just don't believe it's true, but I take it I'm not allowed my beliefs . What fact has disproved my worldview, my worldview is intact as it ever has been?
In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with. Roe v. Wade and Heller do share some striking similarities. For example, Scalia stated in Heller:   "Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."   However, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion. I've heard that Scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms. So neither the text of the Second Amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions. It is an example of judicial lawmaking.
Another oft-repeated lie.
Another strawman.   Explain to me how new information and new features equals to new structures and body parts.   Those links have long been refuted   http://www.creationwiki.org/(Talk.Or...dd_information   http://www.creationwiki.org/(Talk.Or...e_new_features
They do offer a good insulating blanket which would keep the body of the reptile warm which in turn, would allow the reptile to remain active for a longer period of time. This means more time to hunt and reproduce carrying the mutation onwards.
Oh you little tramp!
Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened.
no base for calling it a human being? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being. Seems you have no basis for saying I can't call a fetus a human being.
Like the docking simulation, in development there is a pre-existing fitness landscape (the womb). Both processes converge on similar endpoints each time it is run, both process are biased to a few endpoints and both processes reach local optima (e.g. skin cells) after the process id complete.   http://mybroadband.co.za/vb/picture....pictureid=1857   Figure 1: Similarities between development and a docking simulation employing a memetic algorithm.   There are certainly many parallels between our own designed simulated docking runs and the development of life.
Cornell's writings consistently place him within the collective right camp. Even the arguments that are attributed to him which start this thread show his collective right desire.   His claim to neutrality in the individual/collective right debate is as disingenuous as his interpretations of the SCOTUS opinions in both Miller and Cruikshank:   Greatest Threat to Second Amendment?   Greatest Threat to Second Amendment?   Whether ?neutral? or not, Cornell has proven himself capable of distorting SCOTUS opinions when he does not find that they suit his collective right tastes.
Damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge. Do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?   While Hoyle came up with the term 'the big bang', he was mocking it. Hoyle was a proponent of the Steady State concept of the universe, which he held on to long after it was disproved by empirical evidence.   FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?   Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.
This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.   There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.   You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?
Actually you're wrong. Actually you're very, very wrong. The 5th Amendment, and all the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, only provide protections against government interference, not interference from your neighbors and people who don't have governmental jobs.   But just for the sake of argument, if you want to argue how the man's rights were violated, how about we discuss the rights of the woman? Doesn't she have a right to not be raped? Doesn't she have a right to be secure in her own home against forced invasion?
That is the kind, not degree. Chimps are not a higher animal. They are different.   interesting
To clarify: is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named, or is it the states? By what you've said so far, it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus.   There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?   The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth. I doubt that that law would be a popular one, either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child, you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it.
And that's when her career and popularity took a nosedive.   Now that she's no longer playing the activist, she's becoming popular again.
Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one.
The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan. It does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought. This is where your mistake lies.
He has a bit more basic information about R.A.T.E. on his webpage.   TO also has a page critiquing R.A.T.E. methodology.   Sorry, I know you're looking for more substantial personal feedback, but this is some good basic information that doesn't rely upon a billion links.   You also might consider asking this question on iidb.org, and maybe Dr. Meert will respond to you personally.   More importantly, let us not get hung up on analyzing the raw empirical data only. For example, if I use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for light to flood the room after I turn on the switch, and I come up with 0.06s, you can't argue with my empirical data: I timed it at 0.06s. The fact that human response time is comparatively lousy and that a stopwatch is awful for extremely short time intervals is more significant that the stopwatch reading itself. This is the primary error that R.A.T.E. makes.
It is an acronym for 'Y'oung 'E'arth 'C'reationist. In other words... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God.
Argueing with penfold is like wrestling a pig in the mud, the pig enjoys it.
If logic was invented by man that would mean that when people did not exist neither did logic. That does not sound logical to me. Most people believe there is life eleswhere in the universe (I'm not saying I do but I just want to illustrate a point). If logic was invented by man does that mean aliens elsewhere in the universe do not have logic to guide them?   Just a question.   "In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." (Colossians 2:3)
well...you gotta point there.
See above, yet again
My responses are in bold.
How is killing a child pro child?
they may respect life but what about respecting the quality of life?   if they cared about their children's future they would not breed like rabbits. It is callous to use their children to win the 'numbers game'   quality before quantity.   I don't deny that abortion is murder in the womb though.
Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick.
Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?
No, hiding as an option has not changed since the days of old, with the slight difference that it used to be easier to get out of range. I'm talking about mace, stun guns, tazers, home security (double glazed windows, rhino locks, burglar alarms, CCTV/fake CCTV, panic rooms) and so on.   Although you are quite right to point out that hiding is an option. Non-confrontation for the win.   Highwaymen? At the time of the Constitution there weren't exactly vast suburbs that could be prowled by thieves looking for an open window. Burglary today is more... casual than it used to be, largely thanks to the wonders of home insurance.   No, unjust laws are still passed. If a group of people decide otherwise they become 'terrorists' and are treated as such. Might may not make right, but it does make legal, and the US government has a lot of might.   If only widespread gun ownership was 'safe'...
Or perhaps Mach just doesn't understand the concept of an 'analogy.'   No one was claiming they want 'rights restricted' because of of bathrooms. He's either being beligerent by intentionally portraying the analogy as a premise, or incredibly dense. I'm starting to wonder if it's the latter . . . .
Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.
No. you're not making any sense. Where is symbiote? I got a horrible argument for him to dispell.
You lost me there. Try them how and for what?
You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth   An egg is NOT larva, and larva is NOT a caterpillar, and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo, and a embryo is NOT a fetus, and a fetus is NOT a baby, and a baby is NOT an adult.   I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!
Reasonable people would look for justification for their beliefs.   Many who have beliefs based on faith, however, accept things because they feel like accepting them. Including, absolute truths, and contradictions.   The resultant SHOULD be peaceful acceptance because after all, they can both be correct, yet be in contradiction, according to faith-based belief systems. The reality would probably be, as you say, that they would mix up faith and reason and start claiming one is "actually correct", and the other is "The work of the devil", and proceed to clobber the other religion, absorb their members, abordb the traditions that were "popular" from the other religion, rename them and re-color them to match their religion, and carry on proclaiming truth and the afterlife and mercy and whatever else pops into their heads.   That's of course, based on what I've seen and read.   -Mach
Correct. Form letters go in a junk pile. Individual letters are a different matter.
I believe this is wrong. But this is a private company, and if they want to discriminate based on religion, that's fine, just as a church may outlaw atheists. Do I agree with it? No. But does it have to do with our debate? No. This is about the science classroom. Also, again abiogenesis is a hypothesis, the same level as ID.
http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hosb703.pdf   It doesn't look like the UK has been doing too bad. Crime has actually been decreasing.
Somehow I don't think a high percentage of Ham's "facts" are facts.
No, I think that he's right on target. The drug dealers that are caught here in Michigan usually get caught with weed AND more hardcore drugs. Theyy're "full service" dealers. Weed is a gateway drug, you know.
Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.
And yet the article is about a legal matter.
Mother's choice at all times.
Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.
Is there something wrong with choosing to have a cheese sandwich as opposed to peanut butter and jelly? Do you prefer actually having to make personal moral choices or do you need a rigid and inviolable instruction manual to run your life?
After. Christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent. It arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 19th century. From one follower of a 7th Day Adventist prophetess came "flood geology" in the early 20th century. Later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s, there arose more modern "creation science." It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base.   Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true. Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible. When creationists realized that the biological evolution of species does occur, they decided that God had created original "kinds" and then allow hyper evolution after that. Creationists call hyperevolution variation in kind.
Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding "cold")   No, but there is proof that it's that way, which can be seen through a combination of personal experience and the experiences of others.   The classic example about seeing that the Earth is round is that of the horizon. Why do ships appear to sink as they approach it?
Incorrect.   Evolution is not something that must be adhered to. It is a scientific theory. As such, if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn't account for, then the theory would be altered or scrapped. It's really quite simple.
So now Wiesmann's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree, but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution...
23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so.
Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.
Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say "What might be the best..."   Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.
Some? 90% is more than some in my opinion. That is a horrible waste. Just think if we could retain 50% of the energy we consumed. We could start eating 1/5th of what we normally eat.
Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious.   This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing.
Well, I didn't really mean to go that far. But I'm talking about problems like that all worked out, thought about previously, and that the problem was worked out. I'm talking more about, what if you could make laborers stronger, scientists smarter, and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome, narcolepsy, etc.). I don't think of making everyone the same for that reason. I'm just saying, what if there was a way to better society without going overboard? If the problems were worked out, which I'm sure they will be, what would your moral view on it be?
I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.
And I would like to know why that is. I asked the question in post #2 and got no answer. Are laypersons lacking in intelligence so much that it's hopeless for them to be on the same communication level with scientists? Since they share the same society, put their pants on one leg at a time in the same way, eat, sleep, and share economic processes in comparable ways, it seems to me it would be beneficial for them and laypersons both to understand each other when they use identical terms. (like the word, “theory”)
Because you asked me to quote your lies. I did. Not only can you not find whichever source you claim speaks of birds' infrared vision, you apparently can't find any source that does so. Despite this, you've been whining about how visible and UV camouflage must be moot because of birds IR vision.   And to top it off, rather than admit to your mistaken memory, you're blaming the imaginary source:
How is that silly? You do realize that the vast majority of firearms used in crimes are stolen no? And many of those are stolen from legal buyers. While it is a poor argument to argue that firearms should be banned for that primary reason, the underlying principle of control over supply is hardly silly. Unless you think that control over nuclear weapons is silly. Maybe you would. After all, you are Isly.
And you think this a good thing? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist.
Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist.
I would kind of Like to Discuss your Fascinating use of Caps.   But seriously, your numbers are insane. Somewhere around 8000 gay couples have gotten married in the past couple of years, how in the world do you imagine that they've cost the state hundreds of thousands or millions each? You just made all that up, didn't you?
First of all not all Astronomers believe that.   All though it is a very long way to the closest star we really don't know how far stars are away from us it is not possible to know. It is an educated guess at best.   If you base your beliefs on science you will almost always have to change them so are they really beliefs?   Time and distance are 2 different entities. On the other side of the world it is a diffferent day.   A light year is the distance light would travel in a year if at the speed we have computed it to be on earth. How gravity affects light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theories are. Black holes were created to explain the big bang. There are lots of astonomers that are convinced the big bang is a myth.   If the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the Bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen.   No one really knows the answer so it is a matter of faith what you decide is true.   Both are possible according to science. The powers that be in science are atheist and get the most press. This does not make them right by default.   There is a very good book on this subject Starlight and Time if you are interested in what a brilliant scientist who believes in Creation has to say.   I will be suprised if you are.   I have read Hawkings and have him on audio and video.   To be fair you should take some time and study the opposing view IMO.
Yet another alleged lie, by the Hillary-haters, shown not to be.

How do you define "convenience"?
If that's truly what the organization says, then it's a hypocrite of an organization.
The only person who can take away your sin is God. No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins, so get over it.
Hold up, your changing your argument. You said "I have never been accosted by an armed assailant. Hence, I see no reason I need to carry a concealed handgun in order to be brave enough to move about my hometown.". This is the reason you gave for not carrying a firearm, I was simply countering that argument because it didn't sound very logical to me, still doesn't.   As to your new statment, I'll need more info. What do your consider an "accidental discharge" of a firearm. I ask because I do not consider someone pulling the trigger to be "accidental" and therefore I consider true accidental discharges to be pretty uncommon.   Yes, for most people I think the chances of being in a car accident are greater then the chances of needing a gun for self defense. But, I'm not sure why that would make a difference. If it was reversed I would still where my seatbelt.   God Bless
Actually there is a better solution.   Mandatory male and female birth control pills, financial penalties if you stop taking. Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.
And anyone who thinks this will be seen as an XXXXX and close-minded.
Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.
Why didn't they "fire" and "bar" him in the sixties?
If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?
So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated.
Actually, one can argue that it was a pagan institution long before it was a religious one.
Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded. Hasn't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has. The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance. Here's some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com/andrys/noah
So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. It was all about how they could keep women down. Tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?
You know, I cannot even remember if we covered it in middle school or high school biology. I do remember learning about Mendel and his genetics, but I swear I can't remember if we even mentioned Darwin's name. If we spent any time on it at all, it was very little.   Our biology classes were mostly devoted to taxonomy, anatomy/physiology, and cellular machinery.
Nope. Not part of evolutionary theory. It would be stupid to claim that increased genetic variability would "disallow" any portion of the population from breeding.
Yes...if you ignore people, they eventually go away...except for me, of course.
See above
What is astounding about it? If we had been aborted, we wouldn't have known anything about it. Untold billions of conceptions have been spontaneously aborted. Do you shed tears for those, too?
And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is.
Read to the very end of the verse. "If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her."
Fish to Amphibian supporting evidence frmo here:   Fish/Amphibian   Transition from primitive bony fish to amphibians:   Paleoniscoids again (e.g. Cheirolepis)   Osteolepis -- one of the earliest crossopterygian lobe-finned fishes, still sharing some characters with the lungfish (the other group of lobe-finned fish). Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of bones, and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth.   Eusthenopteron (and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish) -- intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians. Skull very amphibian-like. Strong amphibian-like backbone. Fins very like early amphibian feet.   Icthyostegids (such as Icthyostega and Icthyostegopsis) -- Terrestrial amphibians with many of Eusthenopteron's fish features (e.g., the fin rays of the tail were retained). Some debate about whether Icthyostega should be considered a fish or an amphibian; it is an excellent transitional fossil.   Labyrinthodonts (e.g., Pholidogaster, Pteroplax) -- still have some icthyostegid features, but have lost many of the fish features (e.g., the fin rays are gone, vertebrae are stronger and interlocking, the nasal passage for air intake is well defined.)   And while nothing is ever proven 100% in science, the link between fish and amphibians is pretty conclusive. Evidence for dino to bird evolution just keeps mounting and at present it is the best supported theory. Just look at the recent discovery of an oviraptorosaurian dinosaur with 2 eggs still in it's body, two very bird like eggs.....See here:   dinoeggs   So once again, while not proven 100%, dino to bird evolution is the best supported theory. Do you have anything that is better supported???
You should have said that. I might have agreed with you.
Why conception? When a mature ovum leaves the ovary, it has every potential of turning into a human being. How dare I stand idly by while that potential life is wasted, unfertilized? No; clearly, it is my duty to try to reach that ovum with my seed. God said to be fruitful and multiply, so I am just following God's will.
So you are saying the US system is better?
Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'.
It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.   As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!
So where in there does Behe say that brute luck is actually impossible? Nowhere.   Where in there does Behe say that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out, 100%. Nowhere.   As I originally said, “We can find such an explanation wanting or unsatisfying, but being highly unlikely is not the same as proving it could not happen.” This is quite in line with Behe's statements in his book. Further, PROVING it IMPOSSIBLE is what you would have had to have done to PROVE that evolution is false. Behe says it can't be proven impossible: that it can't be completely refuted.   (And quite frankly, most of us would agree that claiming that an IC system - or multiple IC systems - arose by multiple simultaneous mutations is in no way comparable to claiming that “the word luckily popped into existence yesterday with all the features it now has.” Behe's not being fully honest here.)   What I quoted Behe saying is exactly what he said and is his position on the matter. I have NOT misrepresented Behe's position on this.   Now, a charge of wrongdoing is discarded unless the party making the accusation can fully support his charge: burden of proof falls upon the accuser, not the accused. You've failed to support your charge, so I prevail.   Now, if you want to continue pushing your charge of wrongdoing on my part, you need to show where, in Behe's “Darwin's Black Box”, he goes on to show that brute luck is actually impossible: where Behe shows that brute luck can be absolutely and definitively ruled out, 100%. Until you do, you have failed to rebut my counter to your statements, and, I am also cleared of your false charges.   PS: The only one playing around with context here is YOU! The context of my statements was that you claimed to have PROVEN EVOLUTION false, and I pointed out that:   (1) in order for you to have succeeded, one of several things you would have to do (but didn't) is to DISPROVE multiple, simultaneous mutations (brute luck)   and   (2) Behe himself says that multiple, simultaneous mutations CANNOT be absolutely ruled out.   Try to keep the context, okay.
See my post above, Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument.
I think it's true. Why would someone make that up and pass it off as a real event?   I think the continents probably started separating some time after that, which is how God separated the people.
Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.
Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see.
Got evidence to back that up??   I'm not sure how a stoner's worse than an alcoholic really.   -Wez
Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another, but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body. They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations' as if that justifies anything. There are things that cannot be morally obligated, no matter the relationship, so the argument tries to prove.
Misunderstanding or misrepresentation? Biologists and geneticists do not claim that DNA is isolated from the environment. We are well aware that the environment can cause mutations under many conditions (cosmic radiation, x-ray, etc.). What is denied is that mutations are environmentally directed - in other words, exposure to cosmic radiation will not cause a mutation that will make the organism resistant to cosmic radiation. The mutations will be random.   On the other hand, natural selection IS, by definition, the response of populations to their environment. The environment has been shown to have effects on DNA, i.e., the genome of the population.
Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.
Well, one person got it right...where in the constitution does it say something about health having to be protected?
And Eisenhower:
Source?
If you wanted to be picky about it, I guess you could say that it was a form of last-ditch birth control, after the other forms failed.
The question still remains as to whether this is negative intrusion (which is what the libertarians want) or positive intrusion (what the libertarians do not want.) Anyone with half a brain can know that it's intrusion. The matter becomes complicated when one tries to place it in the category of anti-murder laws or theocratic forced religion laws.
And you people whine at me about using personal insults ( )... anyhow, once a fetus is eight months, I believe, they are fully developed and ready for a premature birth. I was born prematurely, so don't tell me it doesn't happen. So if you get an abortion at eight months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby.
Go pound sand. You're the people who want the Separation of Church and State, remember? Get your sick, satanic mits off the church.
Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age. What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is? What is the importance of knowing if somebody's white, black or mexican when they're buying a gun?
Because violent crime and violent criminals is something that I can't control. Heart disease, that can be worked on with good diet, exercise and medicine if necessary. It's manageable, controllable and can be avoided. You can't do that with a violent criminal.
No, not really...
I think you are the same person as usa all the way and again.. you have no right to talk about murder because you murder the english language everytime you post.   And no.. the baby does not belong to god because there is no baby and I don't know if there is a god or not. Btw.. I'm not going to incubate something in my body because of you think it's wrong because someone who may or may not exist said so.
Hello there. The principle behind a pro-life Christian supporting the death penalty (I am one) is this: We are talking of innocent life. The death penalty is justified for a person who is guilty of commiting a crime against a society that has that law. The child never did anything wrong. I know of other beleivers who don't support the death penalty, so basically, it's an in-house debate.
The comic relief doesn't even recognize it has passed in on, or attempted to!
oh, now we're getting somewhere. Explain more, please. Oh, and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too.
They can "marry" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.
Well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue.
So, you would vote to legislate against it? Ok, now that thats cleared up, why do you consider sex to be so bad? Sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. Sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. Then, if EVERYTHING fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. I doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. It will only cause suffering and fear for women.   I thought we were out of the dark ages already.
Oh boy, you said it!   Is the Earth's Magnetic Field Young?
Sure.   The woman is a person, and individual, sentient human being. She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.   Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.   Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.   And, of course the US Supreme Court agrees with this, thus ruling that per the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, the woman has the right to privacy, to control her onw body.
Well, you have "proved" that the U.S. health insurance does not have any higher administrative cost than Medicare or the rest od the industrialized world. I think your problem is that you are convinced in your head that that in our healthcare there is no waste. And you are trying to square it with the obvious fact that our cost is the highest with nothing to show for it. You will have to admit that there is waste.   For example we have 5x as many MRI scanners than we need, we perform too many tests, we have high adminstrative cost. All these costs will be reduced. There will be fewer of these things PER INSURED. I do not know how many times I have to repeat this before you get it. The volume of this work PER INSURED will decrease. Do you understand that?
Look over the Heller ruling again. All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.   And no, the individual states and cities shouldn't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right, that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment. And worse, you're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it's offensive to some small, insignificant minority somewhere.
So when you're doing math, you're an atheist? Of course not. Just because there is overlap doesn't mean that the two views are identical.
Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is "treating them as breeding animals". Kind of an odd thought.
But the civil war wasn't fought for slavery. If you will recall the average northern soldier wasn't too fond of blacks, and that is not only sugar coating it, but saying it in the nicest terms possible. The civil war was fought to keep the union in tact. Border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons, the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal. Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal. It took some time before they could even fight. Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war.   I won't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal didn't even exist.
Actually Electro, do you remember this thread?   Evidence for a flood? Oddly enough it took 20 pages before one of them even tried to argue against the reasons why the flood did not occur.
I'm not saying we got it all right
Maybe you need to take a hard look at where your rights start infringing on the rights of others. A pretty good case? Dream on. Sure, you have the rigth to take the morning after pill. you do not have the right to force another individual to sell you that pill, any mroe than you have the right to walk into your local ford dealer and demand that they provide your with a chevy. Its just not the way the world works. People can go to another pharmacy or, not. It really does ntoy matter. Retail establichments are able to decide fro themselves what they carry, the governemtn has no place in such decisions. If they decide not to carry the pill, or the pharmacist simply decides they are not going to dispense it, that is their right. It is entirely an issue between employers and their employees and witht he The American Pharmacists Associations policy that allows pharmacists to refuse to fill presciptions on moral grounds, it is hardly an issue there, either.
Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.
Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: "a revolution". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!
Armour piercing ammo, 100% legal. Here is where you can buy SS109 armour piercing ammo: http://ammoman.com/   I agree, the Brady Bill is laughable to criminals who want the contraban items. You do not even have to buy them, you can make them yourself.   I agree that the cops are not the best protection. The best protection is YOU for YOURSELF. Only you are on the spot the quickest when you are threatened. Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened. Seach on any engine: police accidental shooting. It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent. If cops can get to a crime scene in time, they have to sort out the criminal and the victim very quickly under difficult conditions. In essence, they do not get the whole story, until it is over. You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim, only to shoot the cops in the back. That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first.   For my own personal situation, I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection. Also seek training and lots of it. Then practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm, you must still defend your actions in a court of law, especially if human life was taken.   I do not agree with people carrying firearms with no training. That is a very personal decision and I will not stop anyone from carrying a firearm if they choose to do so.
I think that case was in Georgia (a different state) and so far as I know homosexuality was not involved. However if you want to worry about a legal case you need to look at Dover Pa. Not the sticker case in Cobb County.
That was the past. I'm speaking of now.
And what does Marc do?   Try to change the subject.
Yet this need for revenge is far removed from the need for justice. My original post addresses this feeling or need for the criminal to die. It has no relevance in the discussion of justice, only revenge.
And it also took an amendment to give the slaves rights, not a judge.
Certainly it does.
I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.
Isn't agreeing with what? The senate hasn't passed any laws that would restrict right to carry anymore than it already is.
Because feeling safe isn't the same as being safe.   The people on the airplanes of September 11th felt safe just before the terrorists took over. The Virginia Tech victims felt safe before they knew about the killer that managed to slaughter 32 innocents. Everyone involved in any major massacre has always had plenty of reason to feel safe right up until the killings took place. But the fact remains that none of them were safe. If they were safe then they wouldn't have gotten killed.   Feeling safe is nothing more than a false sense of security that can be destroyed at any given moment. I'd rather not be a victim of some violent incident and mistakenly believe that it could never happen to me.   I'd rather actually being safe as opposed to just feeling safe. Feeling safe is just that: just a feeling, it's not anything tangible, it's not something that will do you any good if somebody decides that you're going to be their next target.
Because it shows that Ockham was arguing against what Hi_Its_Me says the Razor is.
Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory.   Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved.
And who makes the decision, Rich? That's the issue, as I see it. I don't believe the government has any business in a woman's body.
I don't get you here.
Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent. You said this:
Because everyone is equal in the eyes of the law, and rightly so. As for moral standing, you see no problem with equating his immoral behaviour with your own response. Most would.
You're right, I think he has made such comments. Sorry. I think he's wrong and went too far.
You could try to be a good person and nevermind about the hocus pocus stuff. I'm not tryimg to convince you of anything. The fact is that what you use a reasons to believe don't hold up under logical scrutiny. Don't justify faith with logic. That only cheapens faith.
Why not? You said yourself kalifornia was a "trend setter". It is alread the law in many states.
So your only link to gay rights and polygamy is a statement put out by a gay rights conference 30 years ago that does not EXPLAIN a link to polygamy, but shows it's support for it?   Hn ...   I'm with Justine on this one. This is a bit of a stretch.   It would be like me implying that your support for "traditional marriage" also supports spousal abuse just because marriages in the past allowed for wife beatings.
You twisted logic strikes again. I realise that if a group of you were to take your guns and rise up against the current administration, you would all be labelled terrorists. This is not evidence that I support the current regime. How you could twist it to seem so is beyond me.   If I were to state that you couldn't take on a fully grown polar bear with just a short pointy stick, would that mean I am supporting the oppressive rule of polar bears? I think you should sit down and carefully think out what you infer from other's arguments before you keep coming out with these ludicrous statements.
I wouldn't say most cjurches, because you cannot prove that. There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks.
Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation.
Well, man might someday gain the capability of fully synthasizing a molecule as complex as DNA from scratch. Of course, he would use the knowledge gained from studying how various DNA codes affect natural biological characteristics in order to properly design that DNA to achieve the desired characteristics. It might be even more difficult to then take that synthesized DNA and put it in an egg and artificial womb that has no natural (as opposed to artificial) biological parts, but even that might be achievable someday through chemical construction. All this means is that humanity might someday be able to copy the methods of nature to create a new being - perhaps even use creativity to create beings of very different natural functions than we see in our world.   It is all interesting to think about and could well be achievable within this century. We already are capable of a large degree of genetic manipulation through cloning and hybridization. One would think that it will only be a matter of time before more complex technologies get developed.   The other question, of course, is - If we could someday create new life using our technology, should we? That would bring up a whole host of issues, including:   - Would we know what we were doing well enough not to cause great harm?   - How would the beings we create be treated?
But I would have been interested in hearing how you explained the above points. My post was a quick hack job, looked up in a few books that I have along with stuff that I remember from my reading. I may have made an error and would be interested in hearing about it. Maybe I can defend my point of view, maybe I can't.   If you put time and effort into a response, why delete it. Redundant posts happen. ss/ww won't pay attention anyway and maybe he would respond to you. He runs from me because he always seems to make himself look like a fool and he realizes it.
What else is new?
So please, feel free to leave this thread to those who DO wish to discuss the issue. No one is forcing you to discuss the topic of this or any other thread. I notice you evidently are not interested in "Understanding "Sexual Prejudice"" That is absolutely fine with me.   Or are you now opposed to "Freedom of Speech" also?
Monty babbles:   Again Monty has shown that he doesn't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks. It is not true that science has "found" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.   And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.   Hank says:   Really? When and by whom? I wasn't even aware that it was an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derived from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial DNA. Possibly the time has been adjusted due to differing estimates of the mutatiion rate, but the concept is valid.   Here is some information. Monty, I would recommend that you read the books suggested so that you might gain some understanding of what you are discussing. You continue to make yourself look foolish. River out of Eden is a good, basic introduction to the main concepts of evolutionary biology.   For information on Mitochondrial Eve see What, if anything, is a Mitochondrial Eve?
Not entirely true. While we can't disprove that God created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. For example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old.
It is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. Most protestors on both sides aren't great.   one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a "hard decision" if you are pro-choice? Is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? Couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? Even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? You hear "It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder?   No one would admit to this but it is statements like "It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. And in that case, I agree...that can be a tough decision.
Microevolution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Who's this directed at? Me or Ray?
Apparently, all them dinosaurs were just too dumb to climb to higher ground or swim (despite the fact that animals are among the first to do so in disasters - example would be the tsunami in Christmas 2004) All of this also avoids the flying reptiles such as the Pteranodons.   Also, apparently humans are unique in that they are the only ones whose corpses bload and float to the water's surface.   What garbage will they come up with next?
Actually, I don't have any respect for creationism in most of it's varied forms. I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met. But they earned that respect.
Better is worse? See above.
I think they should. I mean, if you're under 18, you are still under your parent's guardian. I feel like they have the right to know if their child is getting an abortion.
I will not give up my right to vote. I will not give up my firearms. I consider people taking my right to firearms as dangers as people trying to take away my right to vote.   In other places around the world, firearms are much more important than the right to vote. There are people around the world trying to get a chance to vote by using firearms to establish a system where they can use the right to vote.   For self-preservation? I will use a bazooka if there is tank comming down the street. The immediate threat I am thinking of is a felon with bare hands on parole. That is exactly what the anti-gunners are trying to limit me from doing. Limit my right to self-preservation from a felon on parole. If you read the other threads, especially from VOR, you will see he is about confiscation not gun regulation. I have asked many anti-gunners about confiscation, when they point to models of UK and Austraila I shudder. Those countries are not about regulation, they are about confiscation.
No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution.
You think so? Then accept my terms. Go ahead. See if you're right.

Your stats aren't broken down into meaningful groups, so nothing is learned WRT Muslims.
Exactly.   It seems that anyone can dream up hypotheses in evolutionary psychology.   Here's what Coyne said:
Give it a rest... what is evident here is more coffeehouse vasilation on your part... no foam.
Well, really, they both compensate and reciprocate for one another, you could say.
But they didn't have sexual relations. This was from a sperm bank- there was nothing that made the two people create one being.   Nonetheless, this is a side issue for future debates. My main point is homosexuality is a disorder that the government shouldn't be condoning. The government obviously doesn't condone pedophilia, poligamy, and incest. Why is the government condoning homosexuality?
That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue.
And what would make them separate species? How about wolves and dogs, separate species? How about Great Danes and Chihuahuas? They cannot interbreed under any circumstances (even artificially - the fetus isn't viable).
and a quote from jitobear:
That and VOR keeps flip flopping on his positions and he refuses to clarify his contridictions.
Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.   Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours. I am reminded of Bill Maher who once said about the intelligent design debate: "Because you don't have to teach both sides of an arguement when one side is retarded."
I responded to your posts on the thread of "Lets discuss the actual..." I suggest we continue that discussion there.
Are you sure? Use your google.
Well, your reasoning is certainly muddled, and it seems to be confused with some sort of twisted socio-political agenda, but I don't think I would characterize your piece a filthy collage. But you can call you stuff what you want.
You know that, I know that, but the creationists do not know that.
Notice that nowhere here do you address the claims and evidence -- which the movie apparently lacks -- about the assertions of "the expelled." Trying to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively won't fly with us; these guys are fudging the stories and sharing only selected pieces in a specific attempt to hide what really happened.   For what it's worth, I feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than IDers should feel in research and teaching academia.
I believe that's true, and as a "believer" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be "with" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves "not with" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be "with" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?   Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.
Honestly I'm not sure if it was ever said in the Bible, but I sure have heard a lot of the Bible thumpers saying free will is a gift from God.
You may see a vast differene, many do not. The "moral" grounds for many is simply the justification for their homophobia.   So now it's a massive nation wide government conspiracy to stifle free speech?   Canada stifles and oppresses religious freedom?   Honestly Jyoshu, where do you get this stuff?   This is utter BS, if you can find ANY proof of the Canadian gov't stifling free speech on this issue, religious freedom, or any other issue for that matter, please post it. If not, retract your BS statement, and admit that it's a fabrication.   I honestly don't think I underestimate it at all. I come across a very broad spectrum of people in my line of work, from one end of the scale to the other. The most common negative response I get is from those that are opposed to homosexuality in general and respond along the lines of "I don't like, I don't want to see it, but rights are rights, as long as it doesn't negatively affect me, I don't have a problem with it/I don't really care." I have come across a couple of people who were strongly opposed to the use of the term "marriage" but were fine with allowing homosexual "civil unions".   I think you overestimate how big of a "moral issue" this really is for most people.   Waxy
No. We don't agree. For one thing your faith isn't a theory. Creation as described in Genesis is a myth, in fact, two myths. Furthermore, a scientific theory doesn't mean "wild guess with no foundation". That seems to be what you want the word to mean. In science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested. You see, a theory is predictive. I'll give you some examples of scientific theories. The germ theory of disease, the theory of gravitation, the heliocentric theory, tectonic theory, atomic theory.   Moreover, you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life. It is done all the time. While it may be debatable that a virus is alive, the recent case of SARS making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution.
Holy grail implies it is like a religion, which it is not. If evidence is found that overturns this theory, it will be discarded in favour of a better one.
You don't beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means?
Things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years. Or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process. Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range, any time during those billions of years.
Then show the evidence.
No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic.
And religion is what caused the Crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. Many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called "in the name of atheism".
Old news. There have been accusations of similar stories for years.
So there's no need to be outraged or question a candidate further just on the basis that he represents the lesser-of-two-evils to you? You're using the fact Palin is there to avoid needing to take Biden to task for HIS statements. If, hypothetically speaking, Palin wasn't there at all and Biden had made the statement alone in a stump speech, you would just leave it at that and not take him to task for his position???   Frankly, if he's the candidate you feel best supports gay rights, I would think this statement on his part would be MORE alarming, and all the MORE cause for concern.   So Biden was against gay marriage there too?   If he's against your right to marriage, knowing why might very well give insight into whether he would change on it at some point or actually be anti-gay in OTHER ways too! Frankly, I find this idea of not probing further to at least try to get some insight into motivations on issues to be pretty odd, let alone not criticizing someone for an anti-gay view just because the other candidate is more anti-gay.
Man, these guys can't even get into the science before they're outright lying...
If this is what passes for American healthcare, then your need for change is even more desperate. None of these "treatments" is available on the NHS.
Yes, it is human, biologically. However, it isn't a human being as it isn't alive.
Well sigma, which is more painful??   Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....   OR   A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. It has just as much feeling as the mother.
Humm. More guns, more Concealed Carry and Violent Crime and Murder is down to it's lowest levels since they started to record it. So how can these studies be credible or considered in anyway correct.
Ok, now show your evidence. If you have any, that is.
Well! I guess that just showed you guys. It seems that HeavenBound thinks that having a closed mind is a bad thing. And yet,
It's NOT any of my business, but when presenting information to the readers at large, such topics need to be ####ing addressed, something militant pro-abortionist seldom want to bring up.   I'm actually happy that you had a good operation and think more should go into ensuring ALL women have the same low risk proceedures when necessary.   We're dealing with health aspects, all, not just selective. And there may even be things I'm not aware about to consider.
Well, you will find claims amoung this group that 'If Jews understood their own scriptures, they would accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior', and "Christians are fullfilled Jews".
So umm. What's going on? This was posted a week ago plus about 4 hours ago. I frankly don't care if my opponent posts a day late and would hate to win because of time. BUT the first post was even easier, he could have been typing it as we found judges and I think he mentioned he had started already. I PMed him earlier this week reminding him of the limit and have not recieved a response. Of course maybe the fact that he hasn't logged on since 11/14 has something to do with that.
Guess what, I'm pro-life as well, that is why I'm also pro-choice.
Generally, when someone posts an article without a disclaimer, they agree with the findings and the reasoning of the article provided.   Besides, your statement does not change the fact that the reasoning provided is foolish.
You know what they call people like you?   Victims.
Really? What evidence is that?
I would say that the soul is that part of us that is immortal. It is our essence. Our personality may impact or is impacted by it, but I would say it is far more. Indeed, I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality.   As for the role of God, science has not disproven any of it. Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does. We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it. That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite. I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite. The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye.   I do not see why God and science cannot coexist. Even evolution and creation. Forget planting evidence. That is too far fetched. I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it. I do not know about God or "not god" (if you will) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being. It should be an apparent paradox to me. If it is not, then my concept of God is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to small to be of any use to anyone.   Huck.
Evolution theory is not science at all, it is faith. Period.   How can I conclude that? Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory:   evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould: ?Our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social pre-conceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem.?   Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said: ?we have a prior commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive?Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door.?
Theres a book my mom has called "The trouble with Islam" by some lady. I don't know her name, but it looks like it may bee a good book for you.
And how is this a bad thing?
Mormons believe that Satan is the brother of Jesus.
Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them   Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.
Well, your parents' parents also had parents who had parents who had parents which all streams back down to 2 people who God created...adam and eve. so ultimately your life is a gift from God because the whole human race was created by Him.
There's a distinct difference... so what? No baby at any age can live outside the womb. It still needs care and attention like any other. This difference in age doesn't mean anything.
Having human DNA does not necessarily make one a human being. Transgenic animals can have human DNA, does that make them human beings.
But wouldn't it make it more likely that a gun dealer that was involved in gun trafficking would be audited and caught by the ATF? If there are less FFLs then the ATF has more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer.
You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be.   This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs.
Well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review. The source is listed at the bottom.
You did when you talked about someone loving objects, or a mokey, etc.
Why would they be useless? They aren't useless on birds? And how is this qustion different in any meaningful way from the above? Aren't wings forelimbs with feathers? It seems that soaring or gliding or even faster running would be extremely useful.
I know this is an old posting, but I thought I would add to it. I have built several 1911 clones. Press forge the frame (and slide, sometimes), then mill the parts. I use a CNC mill (about $750,000). A lot fo guys, though, use a $300 minimill from harbor freight. A setup for press forging the parts (press forging is the better modern alternative to drop forging) will set you back less than $200, if you are a good scrounger.   Gun building is probably a more common hobby than you might think. It is hard to tell exactly how many people are doing it, because a homebuilt gun requires no registration, permit to build, or any of that other XXXX (unless you are building an NFA firearm, which is a machine gun). There is even a yahoo group about building your own gun. Fro the faint of heart (those who don't want to forge or cast theri own reciver/frame) there are a bunch of places that will sell you an 80% finished reciever, which doesn't count as a firearm from a legal viewpoint.   I always buy my barrels since it is too much work to do the rifling. In a pinch, it could be done, it just wouldn't be a competition grade barrel. Of course, most firearms you buy don't come with a stock competition grade barrel.
But we certainly have the right to evict such persons.   But then, regardless, the embryo is not a person.
Well, that's generally true of any process that uses energy. Some is wasted.
the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the "greatest possible being". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. "greatest" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that exist   its like "the oldest man alive". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence
The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries. Many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them, and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally. Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves.
So do you want to argue my points or do you want to argue me? Which of my bullits are wrong? Which of them are right?
Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals.
Well right there, you used an oxymoron, "Great" and "Evangelist" got together about as well as Military Inteligence.   Secondly, as I stated before...you left too many other questions unanswered about the "Preacher."
Why should I prove anything, you never do.
I think you need to look up euthanasia, and not only for the correct grammar. Those examples are not euthanasia. Abortion is not the same thing as euthanasia.   Why don't you just say what is on your mind, rather than setting these ham-handed traps you hope someone will fall into? It is clear what your opinion is. If you have something to say, by all means express yourself.
Uh. No they didn't. Have you ever actually taken a biology course?
More likely the criminal will shoot first rather than give the other chap a chance.   There is no real reason for the average citizen to need or have a hand-gun
This remains unspecified. (I explained this in the last paragraph)
And those pillars will be replaced by something stronger like equality and Justice.
No it doesn't, as abortion WAS a legal option in this case.   This was not a legality issue, but an education issue.
Actually it wasn't sitting somewhere since there was no "where" to "sit" and "always" and "eternity" have no meaning outside of time and no "time" existed prior to the "Big Bang", maybe.
Really, then show me how I'm wrong - without dogmatic statements. I would suggest, given the fact that you feel the need to ignore science, deny obvious facts of reason, and cling to evolutionary theory, that it is you that has the problem with religion - your naturalistic religion. I would further suggest that you stop attibuting your personal opinions to science, and start calling your comments what they really are, personal opinion.   -By the way, is everyone who disagrees with you promoting a "religious agenda?" Where have I leaned on religion to make my point? And what makes you think that I need religion to defeat your postion as I have here? I've used science, scientific journals, and good sound reasoning to defeat your comments. I suggest you rethink what you're saying. It sure sounds like you're the one with the "religious agenda."
Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you "view humanity with mental existance as important" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood.
would this be considered intelligent design? to me it would be like winding up a top, loading it with paint, and then letting it spin on paper to create a painting. the process is deliberately set in motion, but the painting itself is random and not deliberate. where the paint falls is not by design, even though the overall pattern would be.   anyway, to answer the question, there are lots of people who believe in a creator as well as evlution, so the beliefs are not mutually exclusive. the problem is that christianity depends upon the account of genesis being true. spontaneous origin is mutually exclusive to genesis, but evolution by itself is not necessarily. but evolution poses other problems such as the age of the earth and the existence of dinosaurs that creationists are stumped by.   in order to belief in evolution, you must, at the very least, disregard the genesis account. and disregarding genesis automatically invalidates christianity. but it doesnt necessarily invalidate the existence of a creator. pretty wierd, huh?
Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the "friendlyatheist.com" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/   But then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist.
think about what you just typed, that doesn't make any sense.
Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out.   Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?
Apologies, that wasn't my intention. My meaning was this; while it was your conclusion, your use of it as an unsupported 'fact' forced us to treat it as an assumption. We had no way by which we could make it a conclusion - that's the purpose of this thread!
Well, thank you for this thread Santafeur. I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff. The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me.   In fact, I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about. What difference does it make? We are here now. Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?
That's the thing, though; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts. supersport, on the other hand, doesn't know any better.
In this case, I will present the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection as evidence that life is evolving. As the evidence has been shown to support it, you are the person who should be presenting evidence. Currently, your assertion that organisms are "devolving" because of mutations has been shown to be faulty.
You are correct.
But I don't hear you saying things like "baseball is always harmful to the player" or "baseball is something no one should have to go through."   You see, if pro-choicers only used the 'pregnancy-is-bad-if-forced argument, they might have a point, but they often don't add the last part.   Besides, no one ever forces a woman to get pregnant in the first place.
Read above for why your argument sucks.   Thanks for proving you never ever ever read anything or watch anything given to you.   Just assume whatever we want and hope people don't laugh at us?
Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.   If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?
17-
Yes.   (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)
Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time.
(Note the key word "also," which admits that it's human).   As for the rest, This is more of the sort of "defensive rationalization" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own "brilliance" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a "parasite" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human.   However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a "parasite," but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency.   Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk.   Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy.   This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions.
It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.   It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.
Actually, submitting samples that will return bogus dates is dishonest. Creationists have done this several times.
I have no idea what this could possibly mean. It makes no sense, semantically or logically. It is so vague as a concept as to be worthless in terms of the pursuit of knowledge.
I believe studies have already been done on that subject.
I think if Islamic fundamentalism shows us nothing else it's that...
True, but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it. I know many christians who believe in god, and jesus etc, but think the bible is completely false, and is only a book of fables. Thats what i was trying to imply.
Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial "Eve", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.   One of the standard rebuttals you hear is "How did the Kangaroos get to Australia"? I don't know if that's covered in the Bible... if God transported them or not.
Except it's not. It's perfectly acceptable to morally disagree with drinking and smoking (and encourage others not to do it) and still believe others should have the freedom to choose for themselves.   chloe,
So you're admitting openly that what is a normal occurrence within the human species is offensive to you. That you find repulsive the very intimacy expressed by your own parents that led to your own existence. Do you see how that innate bitterness against the normal and right feelings that have led to the healthy continuation of the human race is ultimately anti-humanity? Why do you hate the normal propagation of our species Matt? Can't you see that if you were given the power to recreate the world in your image, then the world would cease to exist within one generation? No matter how pro-gay you are, how can you be so anti life in good conscience?
And why would I be anti Christianity when I am Christian?   Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I don't believe in Jesus, or something to that extent, I never said anything to that extent, you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it. I believe in the teachings of Jesus. Yes I'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible, My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times. So she's told me all about it, and what its supposed to teach us.
Well ... I don't think it's a light choice for anyone. (Although I'd imagine, for someone who might be developmentally disabled, for example, it might not mean as much. And I suppose some may not care at all.) I don't think it's a decision women necessarily struggle over, either, however. Nor should they. For many women, the course of action that they need to take is quite clear.   That is, whether or not someone 'should' have a difficult time with this decision, I don't agree. And, I don't think women's motivations in getting abortions, or their personal behavior ITO becoming pregnant are anyone else's concern. Or even if they do have an abortion *blithely*. (Distinguishing from policies about public health education.)   I just think people have to do what's right for them. Finding that or reaching a decision -- well, people are different and have different lives. They have different understandings of biology, different health issues, different relationships, different economic positions, different religious views, or none at all. The circumstances around the pregnancy, different.   I don't agree with the "potentiality" issue either. If *someone* isn't there *yet*, they're not in existence, period. I think there's just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life being taken. It's not "potential" life. It's life all right. But there's no individual except in our imaginations.   To me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. But those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. And the woman comes first. It's between her and her physician. It's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not. And I don't think anyone should have go through any demonstrative motions one way or the other for the anti-abortion camp. It's none of their business.
Iangb, I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims.   I also thought that (by now) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in (in this thread or by private message) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest.'   At this point, I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood's definitions?   QUOTE;
Can I tidy up this leftover part...? Fractionally.
Cases v United States, 131 F. 2d 916 (1st Cir. 1942), cert. Denied sub nom., Velazquez v. U.S, 319 U.S. 770 (1943). Basically, The US Curcuit Court upheld that the Second Amendment didn't apply to weapons that couldn't be carried by an individual.
Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term. A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example. Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils.   So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption.
This whole thing is simply an epistemological argument, for which there is no answer. What is the nature of knowledge? There are positivists (Abe here) and there are constructivists (what Abe says you have to be if you don't believe in god.) This is a metaphysical debate that is decades old and it simply depends upon your point of view for the purpose of the discussion at hand.
Since when are profetallifers "reasonable people"?   How reasonable can it be for them to try to impose their particular answer to a metaphysical question on others who believe differently?
I think the OP said it pretty well. If an organism or cell can process information and then make decisions based on that information, that's intelligence.
I believe that the vast majority of people, if they are well-informed about responsible sexuality, have access to contraception, and are of reasonably sound mind, would much prefer not to experience an abortion and would take precautions to avoid such a possibility.   It is rather tiresome to hear careless and irresponsible talk of whorish women who seek to become pregnant solely so that they may exercise their right to an abortion.   I have never met such a woman. To be sure, there are unbalanced individuals who are riddled with guilt over sexuality and these individuals are incapable of being sexually responsible. I don't associate with such people and since I have never encountered such a person, I must believe that this sort of person comprises a very small minority.   But with the amount of bluster and piffle to the contrary, I must wonder whether or not such blusterers have any connection at all to what really is.
That's true, but how much have we actually learned, and how much have we theorized, with an atheist presupposition, the only presupposition currently allowed?
This joke is based on some reality, "the conquest of the North Pole is traditionally credited to Anglo-American Navy engineer Robert Edwin Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909.   Anyhow, not all jokes are completely true, how many stand up comedians have you heard??? If you were to nit pick every joke out there (being politicaly correct etc) there would be no jokes left!
Actually, Peeling and others on this thread have proven you and Cash to be utterly wrong. The fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant.
why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom.
Tell that to CDC pathologists. Or just read this post.   ETA: Alternatively, let's look at the logic in this way: because the field of quantum mechanics is useless for helping me describe classical physical systems, quantum mechanics must be wrong. I think this illustrates the fallacy satisfactorily.
Paranoia is so ugly. It's not OK to teach scientific theory but it is OK to tell them that mythology is fact?
Mayabe this is a miniscule amount of suffering compared to what awaits you on the flipside. Weather it be an eternity of Bliss or agony and suffering. Who really knows. Mayabe those who have this happen to them have it coming to them?

No, but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition.
According to Gallup about 8% of the U.S. population is atheist. Another poll by CUNY found that 7.7% of those polled responded that they had no religion.
Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates. It's my personal favourite - but what do you think?
You know that what you call "immoralism" is my life. Why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due? You don't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you. I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry.
GOD was proved not to exist many years ago details if you wish.   GOD was proved to exist many years ago details if you wish.

Well I ####,moan,and bitch about it to and I know I can't prove anything,but do'nt logic say an AK47 ASSAULT RIFLE not semi auto but the real deal is going to cost hundreds less south of their border,Know doubt the same for an M16.Also you don't have to worry about smuggling them in as much if at all.Besides it getting harder all the time to get your ASSAULT RIFLES(you know the full auto type)not to mention hand grenades and rpgs at your corner gun shop anymore.Oh yeah less not forget the gun shows,and all there loop holes.   Jus a thought.

That's simply not true;
Really? Intra-species evolution and inter-species evolution are one and the same?   *edit*   I was reading on micro-evolution in wikipedia, here is what they had to say...is this incorrect?   "Typically, observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution; for example, bacterial strains that have become resistant to antibiotics. Because microevolution can be observed directly, both pro-evolution and some anti-evolution groups agree that it is a fact of life."
Tell me who directed it.
This is different than stating that abortion is the same, in principle, as killing a born child. We are back on the question of "Why would someone do this horrible thing" which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people. There are many threads on the subject   That the fetus did not come into existance by it's own choice is really irrelevant. That it did not cause problems of it's own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems.
Actually, I believe it was a Reagan policy continued by both Bushes.
President Obama!? What did I win!?
And my interpretation of my writing is that I didn't mean that. Who has more authority?
And folks that refuse to see the legitimate ones put us all at risk. Touche.
Exactly. It is their fault, but they can do what they choose. It is punishment and you know it, and it is not your job to make sure no "irresponsible" pregnant woman goes unpunished.
Actually, if you bothered to pay any attention whatsoever, it actually goes against your point entirely. Just because WSM and I were both in "heterosexual" Style relationships, doesn't change the fact that both of us are indeed homosexuals and therefore proves that homosexuals do indeed have children, planned or not.   Mine too was kind of a suprise. I was on the "pill" but was also taking antibiotics at the time and for anyone who doesn't already know, antibiotics will completely cancel out the affects of the birth control pill. I was NOT aware of this at the time and low-and-behold I ended up pregnant with my son.   p.s. just for general information, I was not taking "the pill" for birth control reasons.   Not all women who are prescribed it are even sexually active at all. The birth control pill contains synthetic or naturally dirived female hormones, which for some women aids them in attaining a more regular period. Many women atheletes are prescribed birth control because being extremely athletic can disrupt, postpone or completely do away with a woman's natural cycle. Taking birth control helps to "normalize" female hormone levels. Such was my case.
Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET**] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET**]) called the "Cambrian Explosion."51   Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38   Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET**] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, "... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history."51   Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38   In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include "a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans."38   Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But "one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs." Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38   There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38   Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to "the last filament of a trilobite's gill," or the last meal in a worm's gut.38   The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38   Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, "Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects."38   The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38   Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51   The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51   These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38   Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38   Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38   "The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time." - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College50   Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, “In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.”50   http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm
People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things.
Actually, most people do not hold the view that existing marriages should be dissolved. In Massachussetts, it's quite a minority view, almost as low as Bush's approval rating.   In any case, that is irrelevant. I was pointing out why someone might reasonably ask the question you consider so inappropriate. What I haven't seen, either from you or from any of the articles, was what the firefighter's answer was or why he refused to answer. From what I can tell from the scant coverage, he avoided answering but had no trouble discussing his political views. Odd, I think.. or just crappy coverage.
OH? What U.S. Code governs that? What does it say?
You still don't get it. How many times does it have to be explained to you? Populations evolve. No change of any kind in a single organism is evolution. Evolution is the changes in the hereditary (genetic) makeup of populations over time.   You continue to display your ignorance. Evolution is a process that takes place in living things. Just because all of science contradicts your childish belief in mythology doesn't mean that all science is evolution. Because cosmology contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution. Because astronomy contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution. Because geology contradicts your mythology, it must be evolution.   And that is why creationists are such scary people. Their morality comes from a book and threats of eternal punishment. The fundamentalist christian morality is so shallow that they are unable to conceive that others can actually have a higher morality based on self respect.   And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it.
Yep, he dodged it again. Care to explain your views on Creation in the Tanakh for the folks here?
I'll have to apologize here, SoC. I confused you with another poster who also used Christ in his handle. You didn't run from the topic because you weren't the OP of that thread. Sorry about that.   If you'd still like to approach that thread, I'll respond and provide the link, but all readers should be clear that my accusation that SoC scampered away was mistaken, and any willingness to address the arguments would be solely to SoC's credit.
Speaking of which, did you happen to see this image that someone kindly forwarded to me?   http://iowntheworld.com/blog/wp-cont...iew-lo-res.jpg
I see, thanks for answering my question.
Some apply logic, some do not. So much for contradictory thinking.   What evidence do you have that suggests logic exists outside of the human mind? Hold the mythology, please.   from infidels.org -   The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as "the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference." Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.   It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.   Firstly, logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period. It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law; it is, after all, logically consistent. Again, we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal.
To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more "preposterous".
BWAHAHAHAHHAAH!   Innocent citizens are FIVE TIMES more likely to be mistakenly shot by a cop, than a cop even DELIBERATELY by a civilian!   Likewise, if my life is in danger, then I'm not really too worried about my lack of accountability to the person choosing to ENDANGER it; and I'm really sure if he's willling to commit armed murder then he's not too worried about misdemeanor gun-laws.   Psht, it's amazing how stupid, naive and arrogant these anti-gun XXXXXX are.   It's easy to get cute when someone ELSE'S life is on the line, but it's just plain evil to use the guns of the state, to take away someone ELSE'S guns and expose them to danger-- and particularly cowardly and hyopcrticial while cringing behind a safe neighborhood and lifestyle, while hiding from potential danger-- than shamelessly attacking those who simply fight BACK.
as far as all observable evidence dictates, the laws of nature are what sustains the universe. there is not one single function of nature that isnt on "autopilot" as it were. that is, no function needed to sustain the universe occurs outside of natural law. what's more, nothing that defies natural law (whether universe-sustaining or not) ever occurs in observable reality   I'm glad you responded Nu Leader. this is this issue that really hits the religion/science divide. as it is, God has been gradually and subliminally coralled in the spiritual realm. there is absolutely nothing in the physical and observable world that is a function of God, or a manifestation of supernatural power. in other words, in the realm of the physical, God has no turf. even if God does exist, he does not (and by biblical definition, cannot) physically manifest his being nor the effect of his power   this leaves us with the spiritual realm. this realm, whether it exists or not, does affect people. yet this realm is as elusive and intangible as God himself. the same realm that God is believed to abive and reign in, is said to be the same realm that humans enter only when they die. i have many thoughts about the effects of this spiritual realm on reality, but for now i think its sufficient to say that God is limited to the spiritual realm only
What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?   Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?
It would be a great scientific discovery.
Because the effectiveness of other methods don't come close to that of owning a gun for personal protection. If they did then the police wouldn't have guns because it would be redundant and not cost effective.
But then it also doesn't answer the question "does anything exist", nor does it answer an infinite number of "existence" questions. Do "trolls" exist, follows the same reasoning. If you find one, they are no longer a fairy tale/imaginary creature, they are some organic life form that can be measured, tested, and quantified..i.e. no longer an imaginary creature. So they can no more be found than god.   So replace god/troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you'll see why the question "Does god exist?", has no real importance in the physical universe.   (does the tooth fairy exist, does a unicorn exist, do flying pigs exist, etc.)   In fact, I like that statement. The existence of god is not imporant...   Rather - the FAITH in god(s, etc.) is what is "important", and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact.   I think that's why I don't mind so much "religion" per se, it's the human condition that brings suffering, and uncertainty, into our lives and for some people, the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition. (the human condition also brings joy, love, etc., but I'd like that without the pain personally)   I only mind it when things in the physical universe are "attacked" with the premise of belief in god(s), which is a waste of human energy...we have a limited time, don't spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge. And any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions.   ...she's a witch because she MADE the crops die...she must be burned.   ...he broke "god's" law and therefore must be guilty..   ...this is "god's" war..   Yeah, that still scares me. That's why I think, at least in the US, the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important, and accepted. While there are fundamentalists that rail against it...it's hopefully obvious that with ~80% of the US believing in an imaginary "god", but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world, then the two can obviously co-exist, and I'd go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed.   I learned something in responding, thanks for the spark.   -Mach
Maybe you'll have to clear up the difference between "understanding" and "knowing." I know what I think the difference is, but I need to know what you mean when you say "I understand that there is definitely no god."   Personally, I understand that we have no verification one way or another.   All I know is that I don't know one way or the other.
To me, part of the point of the "please, no scripture" comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship God just because the bible says to.   A person could insist that sons pay some form of homage / respect to their father on Father's Fay, but I would argue that it's not reasonable to do so in every case. For example, if the father was physically or sexually abusive, or the father abandoned his children, those would be reasons to fore-go any Father's Day formalities.   And "God" could be viewed as the absent father. Suppose we assume that he created the earth and life on the earth. What's his involvement been since then?   Should we worship him just because he's God?   Or, depending upon how one sees God, is God a being unworthy of worship and idolization?   And along those lines, utilizing the Bible as a reference could be a double-edged sword. The "God" of the Old Testament ordered slavery, misogyny, genocide, women as spoils of war, ...
Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have.
Do me a favor. Write, in your own words, two paragraphs. One explaining the electromagnetic spectrum (and the visible spectrum's place in it), and one discussing rods and cones in the eyes.
Microevolution has occured. Several times over and recorded in the lab and the natural world.   [quote] Give me one peer reviewed paper . Just one. Not the latest dogma from talk origins . 29 evidences for bs.[quote]   Huh. Guess you're wrong.   [quote]Talk Origins does your thinking not mine. Give me peer reviewed documents not the latest political/religious factions babblings. Of course they don't exist but how could they? [quote]   And how does that mean evolution is wrong and creation is correct?   You do realize that even if you somehow manage to prove evolution false (not likely), you are still miles from proving creation right?
Because their properties are contradictory.
He was using it as an example. He was saying that if something in your life causes you to sin, get rid of it!   BTW, thanx for giving me the references to your verses! It is really annoying to have to search through the Bible to find verses that people quote without references.
The thing is, Bush didn't live in Canada.
By removing you mean Killing the innocent of course, which is different to imprisonment of the criminal.
Jurassic Theropods like Compsognathus had hollow bones.   http://www.cbv.ns.ca/marigold/histor...gnathuspic.jpg   Therepodian dinosaurs show clear general skeletal affinities with modern birds such as long limbs, hollow bones, foot with 3 toes in front and 1 reversed toe behind and a long ilium.   Coelophysis, from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs.   Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods, larger, with more bird-like skeletal features: semilunate carpal, bony sternum, long arms and reversed pubis. Striking detailed similarity to birds.   There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here, unfourtunately, the fossil is poor.   Archaeopteryx from 225 Ma, shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features, with the reptilian features predominating. The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian (skull, teeth, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, pelvis, tail, digits, claws, generally unfused bones). Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula (wishbone, for attachment of flight muscles; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too), modified forelimbs, and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers. Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree, but couldn't take off from the ground, since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles, and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds. (Wellnhofer, 1993)   S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx. It had a short trunk, claws on the toes, flight-specialized shoulders, stronger flight- feather bones, tightly folding wrist and short hands.   A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs, with bird-like shoulders. The tail is medium-length with a fused tip.   Then there's Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and other Cretaceous diving birds. There are many fossils. Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones, fusion of hand bones and a short, fused tail). It also still had true socketed teeth, a reptilian trait.   There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.   Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.   There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs.   http://eur.news1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.c...2567138235.jpg   I can provide more info on any of these if you wish.   References   Wellnhofer, P. 1993. Das siebte Exemplar von Archaeopteryx aus den Solnhofener Schichten. Archaeopteryx vol.11, pp. 1-47.

Obviously not about abortion.
You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean "will", "must", or "shall" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it "CAN" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun.
Prove it then. If this is a fact, there will be research on the subject on the net somewhere comparing the effects of the two.   In terms of addiction, alcohol is far worse than pot apparently.   http://www.tfy.drugsense.org/tfy/addictvn.htm
The Civil War was fought to establish the principle that each person owns his own body - a principle that the pro-life crowd is trying to destroy.   Each owns his own body? Are you talking about the woman or the child in the womb?
You consider the county to be like Rosa Parks???
And you believe that to be what? You really need to just say who/what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.
Is that all you've got?
It's your article, not mine
As the Christian Right's poster boy, this is hugely damaging, don't you think? Also makes him very hypocritical (or, dare I say, a FLIPFLOPPER?! ) since he is campaigning against open abortion now.
Well he has further political aspirations..........The 9th circuit in Sodom (SF) is always making law instead of interpreting it........That is why they are over ruled so often.......
The curriculum is legal outside the public school system, and used in private schools. (I left a couple of sample links on the other board.) So do you see those private schools as engaged in child abuse?
No Steve, I realise that there are hetersexuals who practice that filthy pastime of anal sex and other sex acts that the human body is not designed to do. Heterosexuals have no more business doing these things then homosexuals.   Do you realise Steve that E Coli bacteria inhabit the rectum and are in feces? Do you know how sick and E Coli infection can make you? Sodomy is akin to having sex in raw sewage.
Yes Chrstians should be disarmed so the "moral" atheists, humanists, pagans who crucified people should rule over us . . . that would give everyone a warm fuzy feeling inside.   Matt 26: 1 And it happened, when Jesus finished all these sayings, He said to His disciples, 2 You know that the Passover is coming after two days, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.   Of course there are valid reasons why Christ armed His men.   Romans 13: 1 Let every soul be subject to higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, but the existing authorities have been ordained by God. 2 So that the one resisting authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and the ones opposing will receive judgment to themselves. 3 For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire not to fear the authority? Do the good, and you will have praise from it; 4 for it is a servant of God to you for the good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil. 5 Because of this, it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience. 6 For on this account you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing. 7 Then give to all their dues: to the one due tax, the tax; to the one due tribute, the tribute; to the one due fear, the fear; to the one due honor, the honor.   Luke 11: 21 When the strong one, having been armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace. 22 But as soon as one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him; he takes away his armor on which he relied, and deals out his arms.   "a moments notice..." Well it appears the guaranteed scheduled time is on the day of judgment.   Luke 19: 27 But these enemies of mine, those not desiring me to reign over them, bring them here and execute them before me.
Because you've presented no credible evidence to support the claims that private transactions are an established and major source of firearms for criminals.   If you can't prove it's broken, you don't have grounds to call for fixing it.
I've never been to Amsterdam.   A friend of mine went and he liked it.   I'd like to go someday.   Hell, I'd just like to get my XXX anywhere, really.
What, specifically, are you witnessing? A baby being born? A prayer apparently being answered? A near miss? Mysterious coincidences that you interpret as being the work of God? Or do you see dead people rising up out of the grave? And people walking on water? And people turning water into wine and feeding a crowd with a small amount of food?   What kind of miracles are we talking about here?
This past Saturday, my partner and I had a commitment ceremony or wedding if you say care to say.....In my state it is not legally bindingm we did it anyway.....it was more about the emotional commitment two people make to each other in the presence of their friends and family. I tried so hard not to, but when the celebrant asked me to repeat after him, with the vows I wrote my self.....I tried and tried and tried, but couldn't speak. I was too moved by the moment and all I could do was cry....   I love my partner with all my heart....So I wanted to get through, I thought about our taxes (didn't work). So thought about everyone in their underware.....contrary to popular opinoin that doesn't work either.....   I managed to get the words out (don't know how) just did!   This marriage is just as perfect to us, and those that were our witnessess.....as any heterosexual wedding......   The rest of the night was blur, between 50 people wanting my attention and me being really buzzed on white wine.....oh my oh my.......I was pretty shocked!   Marrige is what you decide it is, regardles if the gov was to see it....I am now married.....like it or not.
So? In your religion's view, everyone sins. Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours.

The most often quoted example here is that of Stephen J Gould, who proposed that the jaws evolved in fish as a result of such genes causing a shift in the position of the first 2 gill arches relative to the others so they could be free to evolve as jaws. I think that these drastic genetic changes would be the only discernable difference in the mechanisms between micro &amp; macroevolution.   As for the "typically observable" examples of evolution, I'd like to add that observed speciation events cross the threshold between micro &amp; macro. Also, lineages in the fossil record are easily observable. Genetic markers are, likewise, observable evidence of macroevolution. So it is perfectly legit to say that we can indirectly observe macroevolution by way of this kind of evidence.
Well, if you breed them, you could get taller monkeys with less hair (and other humanlike characteristics). Even so, it would take a long time.
They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?
Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.
So we agree..... What I want to know is why the vocal homosexual 'lobby' insists on the term "marriage?"   emclean, the sanctity of marriage would not be the only thing about marriage to be (harmed?) changed. The whole definition of marriage would change, too.
The article cautions on blithely using natural selection as an explanation for the features of the genetic code.   Article 9:   In this article, the functional integrity and how the architecture of the code relates to it is discussed.   From the article:

Following the original purpose of this thread, I will summarize my own views on abortion. (Note, this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called "Survey of views on abortion"):   For me, the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. On the side of the rights of the mother, there is a very important right to the control over one's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one's will. Some may say that, in agreeing to have sex, a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy, but I strongly disagree. A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used. It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood. The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women, religious or non-religious, conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons. Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts. So, women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex. In the case of unwanted pregnancies, it is a significant burden that they never agreed to. If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy, it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies.   On the other hand, one has the rights of the fetus. What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities. For me, the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind. I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others. My view is that, once a mental existence begins, the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother's rights over her own body, under most circumstances. The neurological view is that a mind cannot exist before the third trimester. Therefore, I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester. For that third trimester, I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother's life or physical or mental health (ex. leading to, say, paralysis or strong possibility of suicide, etc.) and, in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late, to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer (i.e. mercy killing). Otherwise, I believe abortions should be restricted. If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester, she should have to carry the pregnancy to term (minus the perviously mentioned exceptions). She would have had ample time to decide.   Lastly, here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester:   Part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml   http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&amp;id=162
But you can't. You may imagine it but you can't present evidence that supports your position. You can only argue against what you don't understand in the first place. I generally make it a rule to keep my mouth shut unless I have actually had the integrity to educate myself about the basics of a topic. You don't seem to do the same.
just how i said it...   opinion...   like, what you think   of it
Just on my way out, saw this, and YES! I have long believed that this is the heart of the matter, and have tried to make this point with little success from time to time.   I have never seen a direct response to this. Ever. Even in threads where the discussion has carried on in detail on both sides, this concept is totally ignored.   There was a similar, brief hiatus leaning towards this point in one of the threads over at IIDB where creationist spammer Afdave is rapidly losing his dignity and proving himself predictably ignorant in all fields of science including the philosophy of same.   It got really interesting for a bit and the guys over there looked to have actually got through to him for a bit, but then he predictably went into full Gish Gallop mode in order to bury his own cognitive dissonances underneath wave upon wave of standard AiG/EvoFairytale strawmen.   Just my two pence; this is a fascinating psychological point that should be discussed.
If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS (or some other legally recognized union) as married couples, why does it matter which "door" they come in through? They get all the same benefits, including the benefits that come when one partner dies.   What's the beef...except that you can't say that you're "married"?
And for those who are not deadbeats? Would you grant them any "rights?"
Because quite simply, it is all what we observe. One has never observed a mutation that has been seen to increase the information in the genome. If there have been any mutations that have led to an increase in information, please state it.
Here's an interesting one:   Lipoprotein Lipase S447X: A Naturally Occurring Gain-of-Function Mutation.   Brief Reviews   Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis &amp; Vascular Biology. 26(6):1236-1245, June 2006.   Rip, Jaap; Nierman, Melchior C.; Ross, Colin J.; Jukema, Jan Wouter; Hayden, Michael R.; Kastelein, John J.P.; Stroes, Erik S.G.; Kuivenhoven, Jan Albert   Abstract:   mdash;: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. Since the gene was cloned in 1989, more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant. It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X. This review summarizes the current literature on this interesting LPL variant.   This one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries.   Or this one:   APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY, May 1995, p. 2020&#8211;2022 Vol. 61, No. 5   0099-2240/95/$04.0010   Copyright q 1995, American Society for Microbiology   Emergence of Nylon Oligomer Degradation Enzymes in   Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO through Experimental Evolution   IRFAN D. PRIJAMBADA, SEIJI NEGORO,* TETSUYA YOMO, AND ITARU URABE   Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan   Through selective cultivation with 6-aminohexanoate linear dimer, a by-product of nylon-6 manufacture, as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO, which initially has no enzyme activity to degrade this xenobiotic compound, was successfully expanded in its metabolic ability. Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected in   the adapted strains.   http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/5/2020.pdf   We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century.   Barbarian observes:   It's all real DNA. Some of it just doesn't code for anything. But some parts of non-coding DNA (which you call "junk") has other functions besides coding for proteins. .
The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.
But if the repeated tests just confirm the same errors or misinterpretations of the results, all of the independent reviews in the World wont make a difference.

Good shooting! Got two illegal alien perps that had been deported for previous felonies and just committed another after illegally entering the country again.   WE NEED MORE JOE HORNS and a heck of a lot less bradies!   Is this the only case you could find of a CCW exercising his rights (you know the law applies to any citizen of Texas don't you and they need not be licensed?) completely justified in the Penal Code of Texas. Self-defense and defense of a third person or property is justified and required by law...IT IS YOUR PUBLIC DUTY.   Job well done Mr. Horn!!   How come you don't post links (deleted by poster)? This is old news, almost 3 years ago to be exact. Did you think it was sensational? LOL
Hehe.   Putting political messages on such things seems retarded to me though.   -Wez
The biblical end has got to be near. This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people's lives.
No, actually they used the Bible as a basis for their morality. They then applied that morality to the design of a system of government that they wanted to create.   Maybe the majority of Americans are comfortable with the status quo WRT their morals. Who are you to tell them that they have to change for you?
I hope I have already begun to change your mind.
To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition', sure. But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect.
If you feed me a lot of caffinated coffee i start to wiggle and squirm too. I'm not really in any pain.
So a free society is one where the goverment does not have tabs on their citizens? How could then the goverment work when it does not know who they actually govern? The foundation of economics is that you have correct data, else it´s the beginning of corruption not freedom.   And since when was there a dichotomy between freedom and socialism?   Further how does the usage of identification ease the rounding up of suspects? Wouldn´t it be rather MORE risk to be rounded up if you couldn´t identify yourself and thus automatically become suspect than be able to and take yourself out of the calculation?
So once again you're steering away from the debate? I don't understand why your ignoring the debate and going off in a whole new direction even after making this same mistake in your last post. You're still showing that the Bible has a flaw in it and therefore your making up your own story about what happened. You're also making predictions about the future based on your own interpretation. I'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though I doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now.   [quote]The above fully answers the apparent contradiction you and others find in these passages. The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do.[\QUOTE]   It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts. All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up. I guess in your mind this makes sense but I don't think many Christians would even agree with you much less those of us who look for logic.
sinjin - I didn't mean to imply any linkage between your opinions and those of another poster. Apologies.
You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.
Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.
I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.
It's possible that Archaeopteryx is not a direct descendant of modern birds but it's certainly not far from the line and it shares both avian and therepodian characteristics.
The average global temperature follows a sinusoidal pattern, the general consensus is we are supposed to be approaching a peak. Projections show that instead of peaking, there will be continue to be an increase in average global temperature which exceeds that of the peak 4000 years previous.
There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.
No. I am a student and I personally don't have much money. So how could I help them? I have very limited money of my own. I help when I can, but sometimes with my present finances I can't do much. If I had enough money, as I assume you do, than yes I would help them as much as I could. This is just an example of where people feel compassion. And as I have said before, Dawkin's has trouble explaining how the universal feelings could come about through evolution. We would not expect mutated pondscum to produce feelings and morals, ethics, etc.
No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation.
You are correct, but contingency must be in place to deal with it when it occurs.   Look at what happened in Eire with "Case X" in 1992- what happens when a country with the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe has to face up to the issue of pregnacy as a consequence of rape:   http://www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/ireland6.asp   Pages 12-13 of this EU report (Adobe Acrobat reader required):   http://www.newr.bham.ac.uk/pdfs/Repr...m%20Bremen.pdf
You are exactly correct in regard to my intent. IMHO, the allegories of the Bible are meant to teach the spirit of the stories, not actual facts...just as Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are meant to represent the spirit of the seasons. When we are young children, we tend to believe in Santa and Thumper because our parents play the game so well, then as we learn the truth, we put away the belief that they are real but we pass the spirit on to our own children by playing the same game with them.   AIMHO, God teaches us the spirit of creation with the inspired allegories written in the Bible. God created it all, He just did it in a fashion we will likely never fully understand.   AIMHO, there were thousands of Adams and Eves, created after an evolutionary process that started when God created all matter and time.   I'm not trying to warp the Bible at all, just as I would not try to warp the meaning of Santa Claus, even though I know he's not a jolly fat man living at the North Pole surrounded by elves and flying reindeer.
Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts.
Upon reviewing the golden rule "do unto others as you would have them do unto you" I see nothing of any other 'side.' It's very clear--treat others the way you'd want to be treated. No one wants to be treated badly, so if you follow the golden rule, you'll be benevolent.
He had ALREADY MADE the animals. "now the Lord God HAD FORMED..." not "now the Lord God formed..." See the difference? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam. He made the animals before Adam.
Just another anti-gun Blogger.   I could go on, but doing so would boar the heck out of everyone, to include me!
Yes, I believe there will be a lot more to come (as you said, just look at the "hobbits" that were recently discovered). I love this sort of look into the migrations of everyone over the last 160,000 years or so.

The simple fact is that people don't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions, so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape, out of pure selfishness-- like every other atrocity in history.   The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings, fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another's expense; denial is typically the first of these, claiming that the act "does not hurt anyone," however obvious the contrary. Other rationales follow, such as self-preservation, natural right to act, and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim.   While the fabricator typically believes his story original, it is anything but-- it's simply the inevitable course of selfishness.
One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies.
And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.   Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences.
You know, your comparison of those that fought to end segregation, to those that fight to enact gun ban and gun control laws, is nothing more than a cheap and dirty tactic that does nothing to address the issue, and everything to suggest that breaking the law is alright if you're a politician or legislator.   There's a very large difference between people like Rosa Parks, and the mayor of Philadelphia; gun ownership is protected by the Constitution, segregation wasn't.   The fact that you're comparing those who instituted civil disobedience for good reasons, to those who want to violate state laws to pass their own laws because they think they know better and have a right to do so, just shows that you can't address the point at hand.
Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.
When will it stop? Never. They will take every gun, every toy gun, disarm the law enforcment community, give us Nerf batons so we don't actually hurt the criminals, and say that this kinder gentler way of doing things will help. In the meantime murders will go through the roof, like in Australia, rape will escalate, breaking and entering will become common place, and cops will die by the minute. They will not only confiscate the guns, but then charge the owners of those guns for being terrorists. It won't end. In order to establish true dependency upon a government you must force the populous to rely completely on the government for every aspect of life including safety.
Fossils show inherited change. Adaptation does not.
********. Utter fraking ****. Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor. You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians.
Well, here is my take on it. I really believe that only the truly evil end up in Hell. Those like Hitler. I think that anyone else goes to heaven - Wiccans, Atheists, Buddhists, etc. - anyone who follows Christ's message of love, tolerance, and acceptance, whether knowingly or not.   Those who preach hate, and those who act on that hate, like Hitler, the KKK, and any other person/persons filled with hate (sad to say, this seems to apply to our own friend Archie here) are the ones who will end up in hell.
Sorry, your going to have to explain to me how Swiss gun laws are in anyway relevant to a shooting in Missouri.   Missouri allows concealed carry, it's unfortunate for the victims that ABB does not.
Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis.
Sucide? Isn't that a mental health issue? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person, does that cure depression?   If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide.   If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide.
But when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution, which is based on lies and deceptions, they prove right there that they haven't enough knowledge of the truth, nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie. So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins, to the lies that you so proudly defend?   I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so.   So evolution isn't a science, it's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it.
But...but...   I just swallowed 56 zygotes so that they could vote by proxy through me for the Ripofflican(tm) party this upcoming election so they can win. Now I'm going to have all that indigestion for nothin'.   As to driving...don't care.   What I'll miss most is all of those credit card offers that come in their names. There's just so much that they, living though me want to 'buy now and pay later' on. You saying they can't do that?
Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram. I think that you'll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much.
This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.
It was in the news for a while and I'm pretty sure the inquiry found that it was a terrible misfortune based on miscommunication between the hospital and the parents. There was no selling of stolen dead babies for profit type of business going on with is what Fishx implies with the first post.   Sorry, didn't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased. If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives, either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research. Yet, I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first. You're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through, having not been there myself.   Being in an abortion forum, and the nature of the first post it seemed very quite possible that Fishx had had an abortion, though regretted it and wanted the remains to bury - this is a very different case than the one you have unfortunately experienced, hence the question.
So my question is this: Why doesn't a chihuahua birthe a Siberian husky in the Antarctic, or even in Siberia?   Oh, my other question is this: Why do animals die young instead of adapt?
Just to point out, the class that ID is being taught in is a comparative religion class.
First, are you not forcing your beliefs on me when you lobby for, enact, and support a law that legalizes an act that I see as murder?   Second, forcing someone to believe as I do is in no way the essence of Christianity. God gives choices (which is another debate) to man. We must simply choose right or wrong. Jesus wants us to influence, not force. Jesus said to His followers in Matthew 5:14-16, "You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven." If I truly believe in Jesus as my Lord and Saviour (and I do), then I must follow His command to influence (not force) the whole world. It doesn't do any good to only preach to the preached.
Nice try. If America was an Ally to Germany during WWII, to this day you wouldn't forgive US Citizens no matter what excuse they have.
Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.   In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.   BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   "Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria."   "All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme"   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   "Whilst this particular case does not "prove" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution."   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   " In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages   But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.   So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was "proof" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source."   http://www.christianforums.com/t52336
Like most things theists that statement is based on ignorance.
And that didn't have a thing to do with my point.
Well, kind of a boring thread, since everyone agrees, but since I'm new here, I may as well weigh in. Hubby and I have three grown kids and one teen. The grown ones all got the same going-to-college gifts. They got a safe car, a laptop, an emergency credit card, and a personal firearm. I felt this especially important for our daughters.
But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.
We don't live on carbon dioxide. We live from the energy stored in carbon compounds when we break them down.
And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks, and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property. I suppose (but am not familiar enough with all of the details to know for sure) that some even used the Bible to justify linching blacks.
If I am to believe in something even if it's scientific, I should be able to challenge the belief's of the person who's pushing it. If they don't believe in what they're selling, why should I.
Actually just as many atheist help the needy.   Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable.   Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not "good, church-going catholics." Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need
Yeah, back in the Late 60, because The Black Panther Party was publicly armed, and had publicly advocated Offing the Pigs, our law makers granted the police the law that said it was illegal for anyone to transport any firearm within Ohio. They did it with the understanding that they would not abuse the privilege that was granted for their protection. Well, 40 years went by, and new officers seeing this law on the books started enforcing it. After all, why not, It is the law, and their is no excuse for the law! Period!   Well, Ohioans for Concealed Carry and a bunch of others, decided enough was enough, and contacted Ohio law makers who took it off the books because it wasn't being used, as agreed upon!

First of all rape is one of the most under-reported crimes so it makes sense that abortion due to rape/incest is also under-reported so that makes your assumptions and numbers off.But of course you are missing the whole point.You are not the one being raped so it isn't YOUR choice.I don't need you making choices for me or telling me what is and isn't good for my emotional health.If one gets raped and DOES NOT want to be pregnant who are you tell them they have to be? Abortion should be legal for everybody who wants one not just rape/incest victims,for the simple reason that no human being has the right to substain life by using the body of another why should a fetus have more rights than actual persons?
Yes, but we had no way to tell until we found them again, now had we?
What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842).
my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.
If guns laws don't affect criminals then how do you explain the low rates of criminal gun use in nations like the UK?
This why we think you're a liar.   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dino...teocalcin.html
Nobody I know sanctions adultery. There are already serious consequences built in against it. As far a same sex marriage, I know of nobody that is suggesting legal penalties for it unless one considers the refusal to legally recognize it a legal penalty. Certainly nobody has been jailed or fined for attempting such marriages. Privately performed ceremonies as such are not punished.
Largely, out of date. To paraphrase myself from earlier, the differences between 'then' and 'now' are as follows:   Increased availability and proficiency of viable alternatives for self-defence.   Increased availability and improved variety/design of handguns.   Different type of 'gun crime' - it is now largely opportunistic.   Today's government need not fear almost any citizens militia, unless absolutely overwhelming.   Today's government is less in need of a (potential) extra army to defend against foreign assault.   I may have missed some...
To each his own...if you got it - flaunt it. Think of all the pretty, fashionable gun rigs that would spawn. Darn sinjin, you might have to get an outfit to get a date Course if you carried concealed like say, Mike Hammer, you might have to get a bowler or little CS hat?   Think of all the jobs it would create. Leather workers. Engravers. Gun finishes. More stylish guns. Corner gun stores and ammo at the local grocery, mail order business and on and on and on.   "Posers"? That is about all there is in kalifornia now isn't it? It doesn't bother you to watch scantily clad women...or men, whatever your preference is; why would full free exercise of a right freely stated in the Constitution be any different?   Oh, and on topic, end the pathetic pleas of the brady cowards and howls from VPC calling for discrimination and getting sued for demanding a Starbucks or any other emporium banish a citizen exercising a right.
And you've been failing miserably, partly because your definition of "atheism" is asinine. Even most Christians would disagree with you.
Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.
I think a more telling question would be, why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe? It seems completely idiotic to me.   Smiley
Wouldn't it be wonderful if every woman in the world had access to decent prenatal care, if every woman in the world could be guanateed safe childbirth, wouldn't it be wonderful?   The entire series is at:   http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/opinion/10gift.html   And, if men had to suffer the torture of being in labor for a week and having their insides torn out, don't you think the male-centered world would truly care more about the welfare of women and children?
I think such a move would qualify as a recognized declaration of war.
Be wary of names. 'junk' DNA is not rubbish ... it's called 'junk' because we don't know entirely what it is used for... But just look at all the blank spaces on this post. They are nothing, but they are keeping the words in order.   Evolutionaries are putting too much faith in names of words - such as human embryonic 'gill slits'   or   'transitional' fossil
Or helpful.
maybe, but see, that does not match the materialist universe?
And certain versions of Mark:   15He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”   Are they mistakenly reading this?
Well since posting on this thread has died and this seems to me to be the most interesting atheistic theory, I want to get a bit of clarification.   First, what do you mean by being allowed to cease providing for it at any age, but never allowed to kill it? By this do you mean that to cease providing for during the first trimester is not killing it? Is that because it is not alive at that time?   If I follow you (and I'm not sure I do) should the mother be allowed to have the baby removed at some point during the third trimester, after which it must be kept alive (and perhaps put up for adoption)?
Do you think this resistance got their most useful weapons out of a normal store? Please don´t try such arguments without knowing about European history.
Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts, and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament, certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century. I don't whether it is "generally accepted" that the text was altered, it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general.
I'm not.   ---
Banning abortion is a tool with which to punish women you deem promiscuous or immoral and recreate through a police state a mythical golden age of christian virtue, got you.   The rest is just a cover story in the same way biblical creationists who want their religion brought into the school system advocate "intelligent design".   They call it "lying for baby Jesus".
Well said.   With this religion, the gap is very wide between the "average guy" and "authority", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government.
would that be legaly owned guns, or criminals who have guns (and also ues guns) for there crimes? most Gang members have guns, if they are killed in a drive by shooting, is the gun responsable, or would it be the illegal activitys?
Since I was there, I'll give you an objective rundown:   1.) Dawkins didn't "crash" anything. He watched the movie without saying a word and participated in a Q&amp;A session with the producer at the end --a session that the producer deliberately started.   2.) There was no "sneaking" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration.   3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event.   This all begs the question: What in God's name are they so bloody afraid of?
Stop trying to muddy the waters. I was talking about developed nations with lower murder rates. You suddenly bring Chicago into the debate- a city with open borders in a nation where guns are freely available. Even if gun control hasn't worked there it doesn't follow that gun laws can't work on a national level.
Genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. Why do you think otherwise? Remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow. Please give me one way those two things relate to each other.
Just like no one is really "for" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war.
You then cite the Wikipedia entry on Spencer:
Then you are just throwing around words without knowing what they mean. Instead you give me a link to a page of pseudoscience. Are those the ones who lied to you?
I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.
I don't understand your question. If law-abiding gun owners were overwhelming those who should not have access to guns, those who use guns unlawfully, I would be very pleased.   But, as far as I can see, the only goal of the gunners is to make sure that everyone has a gun, no matter how insane, no matter how stupid, no matter how incapable they may be to own such easy-to-use instruments of death.
The idea here is to demonstrate that the odds of them realizing the same Genesis is impossible. That is unless God came back again, spoke his word into a book through the scribblings of random religious scholars. If you accept that this is inevitable, you are delusional.   The most likely thing would be for humans to come up with an entirely different religious doctrine. I would be willing to bet that it would pass through polytheism into monotheism as more information became available and eventually we would end up right where we are now. The problem with this scenario is that evolution would probably never be confirmed since our biological history would not be apparent. We would come up with theories that God made us and perhaps even some screwballs would say we were all part of an experiment and were placed on the planet by our ancestors a couple hundred thousand years prior.
Just so you know Peach, the 167 death row inmates are now serving life in prison. At least that one who's not guilty might now have a chance to be free.
Can't say.
So indignities offered our citizens will be tolerated if dispensed in small doses?   Maybe we might educate the pirates what they should "know better" than to try.   My taxes pay to have a Navy presence around the world. Americans are American interests.
What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking.
NOt true,   California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal.
Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory.
I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people.
So individual cells contract to move cytoplasm around and to transport oxygen within itself?
And SS is once again wrong. If you really believe that then try to tell your genes to give you tiger stripes which will be inherited by your children. Good luck.
And it's only wishful thinking that they haven't. You are in no better position than I am. You don't know anymore than I do. Science has admitted that antarctica was much warmer several thousand years ago...not only that but the following map shows that the continent was not frozen. And if it was not frozen several hundreds years ago....and it was not frozen 4-5,000 years ago, as it was stated on this next seal link, then it's pretty safe to say that animals and humans could have both been there in recent history (within a few thousand years.) I agree this is no proof that it was attached, however, it is proof that the weather/temperature was DRASTICALLY different on antarctica than science has admitted.....and there's got to be a reason for this drastic change in temperatures.   http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_1.htm   http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...ent-seals.html   In an Antarctic "ghost town," freeze-dried whiskers, skin, and bones provide evidence that the South Pole was a much warmer place not too long ago, a new study reveals.   "We thought, This is really strange. If they are elephant seals, what are they doing here?" Hall said.   The discovery, scientists say, is the first hard evidence for a warming period in the region between 2,300 and 1,100 years ago.   An earlier warming period, between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago, has been recognized by other researchers and is believed to have been widespread, at least throughout the Southern Hemisphere. (so widespread that there wasn't snow on the ground and it wasn't frozen over!)
That isn't my logic. My logic states that banning doctors would cause more deaths and our current system does. You are trying to debate that doctors are threatening withour realizing that they have great rewards as well. My logic is to look for the risk and reward and not just focus on one side of the debate.   Your logic was that since doctors cause deaths then they should be banned if guns are, correct? Then why isn't it also consistant with your logic to believe that we should ban food since food causes deaths?   So lets clairfy here, do you believe that guns have a better risk/reward than doctors? If you HAD to ban one which would it be? I await your sidestep of the question.   lol, now your comparing the Jews to current US gun issues? Why did you choose to do this? The risk-reward for Jews is different than the risk-reward for the US. Jews probably would have faired better if the Germans used Japanise gun control laws.
No. I never mentioned grades. You brought that one up. I'm saying that having guns on school campus isn't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area.
No, it's not an "inability" at all. It's a simple matter of you trying to take what IS a religious issue for many people and divorce it from religion altogether. That's not going to happen for many people.   And BTW, if you are going to refer to people as "Antis", at least be upfront about what you feel they are "anti-" toward. "Anti-gay?" "Anti-gay marriage?" What?   But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.
Sorry, but that's not in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Try again.
Well it could mean simple instinct, and I think you will find it was only applied to animals with brains. EAM attributes "intelligence" even to bacteria and to corn plants, trees, jellyfish, single celled eukaryotes etc. If one is to consider intelligence the main driver of adaptation it must be omnipresent in living organisms - there is zero support for this concept.
But then, there also is absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence.
Do the words "govt. by the people and for the people" not matter to you at all? Furthermore, to say that the constitution shouldn't be allowed under the vote of the people itself in unconstitutional, since that's the only way the Constitution CAN be amended. (2/3 of states)   A country that uses judges to determine such sweeping things as redefining marriage is a "legistocracy", which we are quickly turning into as a nation. Even though judges are supposed to interpret the constitution, it's still putting the fate of the people in the hands of individuals regarding their laws. This is not very far removed from monarchy. Personally, I think our founding fathers and the Constitutional framers are rolling over in their graves right now.
Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce.
Just to contribute, I'm pro-gun, have had training in the proper use and laws in my area, and have owned weapons for more than 30 years.
Who swings from Christmas cake to chrismas cake?   Tarzipan!
Ditto squared. If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified. And I must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason, the public stance against them might not be so strong.
yes and my post was proving that
Wow. A very unusual and distressing story, and probably why saline abortions are no longer used.   It is very unfortunate for her to have to live with that disability.
Notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question. My bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book, Simpson would not be saying what Toxey wants him to say.
Actually, qualified biologists know no such thing. In fact, I've never known one who would agree with that assertion. Can you give us some peer reviewed references to support your assertion?
refuted?   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as "moleclues to man" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere.
The other forest does not photosynthesize all year round, the other forest is also in just as much danger as the rainforest. For some reason, radical environmentalists choose to place undue emphasis on the de-forestation of rainforest rather than global forest as a whole.
Well, that just struck a chord with me. People of both sides say, “We got the facts! The facts support our side!” but it isn't about the facts but how we react to them.
Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of "creation science" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion.
Where were the French on D-Day and the Normandy Invasion when Hitler was burglering their Nation? I don't recall history mentioning a Frenchman around but the Americans were saving their rears once again...
Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)
Because guns are the best method available on the market. Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid.   Better locks? The best they'll do is slow down the person seeking to harm you, their effectiveness is contingent on the strength of the door they're on.   Alarms? So somebody will know that you're in danger, what then? That won't get the police there any faster than dialing 911.   Non-lethal weapons? Somethings non-lethal is a non-option. Brandishing a can of pepper spray won't cause an attacker to flee for their life, it won't hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them, it won't stop a violent individual from across the room, and it sure as hell won't affect somebody that's doped up on narcotics.   And stun guns are more useless than knives, because as I've said before, you need to get right up against your attacker to use them. You have to get within stabbing distance to shock them, do you really want that to be your best option for protecting yourself? The idea is to keep the bad guy away from you, not let them get right next to you.   All of these non-lethal devices, they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurting or possibly killing you, is worth more than your own life. That belief is stupid and should be done away with. Ask any woman that's ever been raped if they feel that their attacker deserves to live more than they do.
Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments........
I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. Until then I'll remain skeptical. Let's remember that Democrats and liberals hunt. Remove that group and what's left? Something less than 20% of Americans that own only handguns.
Basic law 101: You can drive by 15 1/2 with A LICENSED ADULT OVER 25 IN THE CAR. Not 18 or 21, but 25 so it isn't a matter of potential peers watching each other. And your opening post referred to 14 year olds or above, as it shows below.
Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.
Since you bring it up, I do think that you are a nut. But your site is even nuttier. Not one shred of evidence that I found - just assertion. Moreover, the author doesn't seem to know the difference between an hypothesis and a theory.
We Americans do not care the government of the UK now under the control of sharia law hates freedom.   America is a Constitutional Republic where the Bill of rights secure our freedom.   I seem to recall you brits coming over here and demanding we lay down our guns and it did not go so well. And neither will it go well for any us politician's that try it as well. America has no reason to listen to people in the uk about gun control and now Knife control when its shockingly clear that criminals can still get any gun they want. Not to mention the fact that history has shown that time and time again what happens when the government wants its citizens to turn in the tools of freedom what happens.   "God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend it." - Daniel Webster   "Government is not reason. It is not eloquence. It is a force, like fire: a dangerous servant and a terrible master." - George Washington   "With reasonable men I will reason; with humane men I will plead; but with tyrants, I will give no quarter, nor waste arguments where they will certainly be lost." - William Lloyd Garrison   # "If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of legislation should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of crime rates reduced by such legislation. That they cannot do so after a century and a half of trying that they must sweep under the rug the southern attempts at gun control in the 1870-1910 period, the northeastern attempts in the 1920-1939 period, and the attempts at both Federal and State levels in 1965-1976 - establishes the repeated, complete, and inevitable failure of gun laws to control crime." -- Senator Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) quoted from "The Right to Keep and Bear Arms, Report of the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, February 1982, p. vii."   # "Congress has no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ...the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people." - Tench Coxe, 20 Feb 1788;
The Skeptic has requested no judges.   This actually suits me as there are too many of you that I'd have to pick from and I therefore avoid slighting anyone by not picking them
Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results.
True.
So, you don't see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun?? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one.
And you still have provided no evidence.
Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that "incipient organ" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying "what good is half a wing." Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does "fully functional" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.
Well let me put it like this, I consider it your duty because if you don't protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else. Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.   This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.   More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government.
Which is what they did to the Jews.
Is the Ammo Shortage the Result of a Government Conspiracy or an NRA Marketing Campaign?
It's evidence of EAM. Probably she comes from a large family. Her mother always had her hands full and was on her feet day and night.
A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.
**   Quod erat demonstrandum.
no, you just live on delusions.   you can't argue the merits of creationism on their own because they don't exist.   Creationism is a fraud regardless of the existance of evolution.
And science helped Stenger write his book. How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints?   another
Well then this doesn't answer my question.   If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com   So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?
If atheism is a religion, than yes and atheism. If it's not then no.   _________________
LOL! If my post was about either of those things, I would cut it down. The vast majority of the post, however, is about the objections to irreducible complexity.
These "infants" do. My mother could have aborted me and she chose to have me.   And if the state decides to keep abortion legal? Then you don't care if these "gifts from God" have a chance or not?
You know 'my kind'? How very presumptuous on your part. Then you know individual choice is the issue, not enforced medical procedures. You didn't answer the question regarding pregnant women who intend to carry to term being required to have a sonogram.
Well, I am a creationist, and I would hope I can think logically (it's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have). The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple. In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it's environments. In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds. If this is possible I pose a few questions for you.   1) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory?   2) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve, while others of the same species did not? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now? Why didn't all apes evolve into humans?   3) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils. How do you know how old a fossil is? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in, but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it! That's a classical example of circular reasoning.   I am not a scientist, so I cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do. If you are truly interested in learning more about the creationist arguments against evolution you can check out the article located at http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1106ng.asp. This article also has many links to other articles with even more information.
He is a hell of a lot wiser than thee.
Well now, there you go. . . .RIGHT ON!!
But your proof didn't claim that God could do anything possible. Maybe only one person could build a computer, maybe one person could make a car, maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes. That doesn't mean that God can do ALL of these things. It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being, we can call him god and thus he exists. Of course this wouldn't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being.
I had researched some stuff about viruses that was applicable about life in general because it is the only thing that is not defintely classified.   So the argument was about life, the other stuff was just peripheral. Don't make such a big deal about including other tings in it.
Yes. Oddly, the picture makes as much sense as most creationists.
You mean, the perpetrator is convicted and the defender acquitted? Yes, that's the rule and not the exception. Notice here how no-one ended up dead, or even particularly seriously injured. Additionally the circumstances described are incredibly rare, that's why it makes the news.
So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?
I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated.
Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.   To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.   You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two.
Doesn't it ever bother you that you have to come up with ridiculous hypothetical sci-fi scenarios to attempt to prove your side?   First of all, do you really think a head on life support is going to "be no different mentally from someone with a body."? I would say that would probably mess with somebody's head a bit.   Secondly, you sound like you believe this person who is a head on life support deserves equal rights. They are just as helpless as a fetus in the womb. Are you saying it's okay to murder people who can't think and talk? Do you believe that thinking and talking is what qualifies a person for rights?
What is your point? Should we revert to old laws that allow for slavery?   Over the history of mankind we have struggled to understand God. God has revealled part of Himself to us, but it is difficult for the limited mind to know the unlimited mind.   The US had laws enabling this? Does this mean you weren't a democracy then?   When you were a child, and had total awe of your parents, and believed what they told you, were you less of a person then?   Surely you understand that what your parents taught you then, was a part of you growining and becoming an adult.   God for instance calls Himself 'Father'. This isn't because He has 'male sex organs' but because it is the best way for us to understand His relationship to us.   Likewise, the Jews made laws in order to best live according to God's Will. They did make mistakes, and got bogged down in the law. Jesus came (as promised by God) and liberated us from the entrapment we had set for ourselves.   Surely you don't advocate that we should return to a strict observence of Mosaic laws?
If this is true, then it should cover the fetus since there is no difference between the fetus and the infant besides size and location. Every adult was once a teen, every teen was once a child, every child was once an infant and every infant was once a fetus.
College. They are normally studied for two years between the ages of 16 and 18 before going to uni.
LOL TOOO FUNNY
The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc
They aren't afraid of that. That a government agency would actually be financially competitive is ridiculous.   The only way it could compete for customers would be by running at an enormous loss or legislating away competition. That's what people are "afraid" of, not some idiotic speculation that government is great at business.
A lot of work has been done on that topic. I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book, but it is definitely worth the read.
'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.   Secondly, the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to 'myth'.   Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood?   PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post.
And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the "genuineness" of ~2000 year old manuscripts...
You are free to disagree with the article, Chemist99a, but it was written by a scientist. You are quite free to believe biological complexity is the result of "natural selection" somehow organizing a bunch of genetic accidents into complex biological systems. I suspect you will become increasingly unable to impose that view upon everyone else.   Questions about Materialismwith some pretty funny stuff about Freud.
um, yeah, you could say that... (won't argue... left up to the evolution board)
So what? If somebody wants to die then they'll kill themselves no matter what.
...and if RMNS doesn't explain the development of hands or feet, it's pretty safe to say it doesn't explain the development of anything else, either.
Huh? Did we win? When?
But you think SETI is worthwhile!
Only when it is anti-intellecutal relgion, such as those YEC's.   Most relgiions are much more reasonable.
But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent.
And many of those countries are having problems with it. Furthermore, we aren't even proposing what other countries have.
Archie, instead of deciding before hand that I'm wrong, read what I'm saying. What trees were growing during this flood? I'm guessing there were no acorns sprouting into oaks during the flood. Therefore, in this flood sediment, we would find no rooted trees. We would find no burrows, and we would find no tracks.   Now we've seen you can't answer my question. Whether this is because you didn't understand it, or didn't want to consider it, I don't know. But there is no global flood sediment which meets the criteria neccessary to demonstrate a global flood.
And where, pray tell are you pulling THIS strawman from?
So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say "Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."
The 'teachings' either have no substance, or are certainly not original. Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God, and why this figure commands worship and obeisance.
Just like we waited until after society decided how it would view civil rights for blacks?   No one is forcing you to debate the constitutional issues. If you don't wish to, fine; don't. I seriously doubt if anyone would miss your input.
First of all. Excuse me for my english writing-skills.   Being a Norwegian citizen with free universal healthcare, it is pretty hard to understand why many of you Americans are so afraid of a little more govermental influence in the healtcare-business. Everybody knows that healthcare costs money. So why accept that a large ammount of your money is going right in the pockets of the insurancecompanies? Shouldn´t your money result in healthcare and not in profit for some greedy company?   To be honest I´m happy to be Norwegian instead of American.   When I get sick I can go to any hospital and get the best treatment available without having to worry about the costs. What´s wrong with that guys? Of course it comes at a price. We probably pay higher taxes than you. But I do not pay for insurance, and bottom line I think most people are better off this way. At least I´m getting healthcare for my money without supporting insurancecompanies that makes a profit out of peoples health-issues.   Any comments?
It's a flawed step in the right direction.   I support it compared to nothing. I did not support it when they were considering CUs vs. full marriage. They took the politically expedient way out.   Lest you leap to any unwarranted conclusions, my main objection is the blatent inequality inhererent in CUs.
No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here.
And i dont really believe in god because he has shown us NO compelling evidence of his existance.
That sentence doesn't even make sense. Did it occur to you that you should actually think about what you are going to say and express actual ideas?
Simple. The big government people will tell you that it's in everybody's best interest. The criminals will just kill you without debate.
Why are you dishonest enough to claim that you aren't trying to get YEC into the schools.
But I already pointed out the mark of Cain in another thread.   http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...57&amp;postcount=1   You see, this particular gene has but two alleles. One exists in the majority of humans. That allele, along with several other genes involved in pigmentation create people with various shades of brown to very brown skin. The second allele was created by a more recent mutation and spread in a more limited population. That allele produces white skin.
Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:   http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfm   It is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something.
And depending on what human is "finding the answers" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings.
Actually, evolution occurs on the level of the population: individuals don't change, but populations do. See the examples above.
Pretty good considering Darwin wasn't aware of genetics. Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859. The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms.
Zoos are indeed a good example. Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats, penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates. And there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo: the absence of any predators, and the absence of any prey. So why don't the animals quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who aren't present?
You got it. People make mistakes. Finally you see that scientists are just as human as religious people.
yeah, this is clearly the best thread on these forums in probably the past year....give us some more pics
You could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out.
I think I, and the other members of what I'll call the "scientific community", must be masochists of sorts as well, we continually return to these threads and bang our heads against minds that are stone walls - completely impervious to reason or logic.   I think, no, I know, that there are two main reasons why I return to these threads. The first one is simple, I'm amazed at the scientific illiteracy of the average YEC, especially when science is often their justification for belief.   The second and major reason is simply my fascination with how the mind of the Creationist works. Their desperation to justify their faith is so powerful it drives them to completely abandon mainstream science and logic in favour of an isolated coccoon of reality. The insecurity in their faith that the entire pseudoscience of creationism betrays is the most ironic part.   As you say, most quickly realize that they're in over their heads, that what they've been told in their churches doesn't stand up to scrutiny in the real world. So, rather than continuing down a path that will bring them no good, they retreat and bury their heads in the comforting sand of "not knowing any better". However, there always seems to be one or two that are so deeply entrenched, that they simply can't retreat, they've got too much invested.   The psychology, more than the science, is fascinating to me.   Waxy
What?
Hmmm... so, barren women can not have a valid point of view nor women in the stage of menopause because it does not affect them personally. Perhaps you should tell the moderator to institute women only Forums, men only Forums, gays only Forums…. etc
If you think something is correct then you believe this.   That's all believe means.   I believe the above statement is very true.   Except that you wouldn't have to completely change your ideas or beliefs about the universe all the time. But you'd have to modify them.   Anyway, who said beliefs had to be static and fixed?
Just because it is human doesn't mean it's a human being. I'm not sure what grade you're in but that's basic biology 101. Your ears are human. Your ears are NOT human beings.
In my reading of the Declaration (and using the 1st. Amendment as a filter) it doesn't matter who or what the founders meant by "Creator." The conlusion is the same; regardless.   Namely; The fact that the founders considered our basic rights to be inherrent.
I think he meant a sycophant.
In Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, all are one in Christ Jesus - Galatians 3:28   Jesus doesn't care whether you're male or female.
And the answer is: we don't know. Maybe it came from nowhere. Maybe it was created. We don't know.
But it has never been claimed that everything developet simultaneously. Probably not.   So back to the original question that you ducked with ad hoc arguments. What is Archaeopteryx. If it is a bird, why does it have a tail, grastalia, teeth, pre-orbital fenestra, and on and on. If it isn't a bird then why does it have feathers, opposable hallux, pneumatic bones, a furcula, and even a small carina in one specimen? How can creationism explain Archaeopteryx?   http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/...graphica_1.jpg
The purposeful taking of life regulated by the government is something that is decided by the people. The people decide what determines what is allowable and what is not. When it is acceptable and when it is not. This is done in agreement, obviously not unanimous. Theses laws are created by the view of society at the time. Our society permits the ability to change those laws as our values change.   You may call it murder, but you are wrong. There is no logical argument you can present to make your view correct. To suggest that legal abortion is anything else is an expression of your frustration why others don't share your views. There is no logic in your argument it's pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problems that don't go your way.   If you think your view is indeed the view that is best for the people then be thankful in the US the opportunity exists for you to effect that. I can assure you though lieing about it, sensationalizing it, bullying people about it isn't going to get many people to consider you.   Please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the rights, or feelings or value of the fetus remember what I said about we as a society decided what is acceptable and what is not. We make these laws for ourselves for that reason, because we do attempt to value life. That attempt does not always satisfy all of the people all of the time, but it never will.   I don't need a formula to understand how our society functions nor do I stomp my foot and throw insults or intimidate people who don't see you being right. Nor would I justify behavior that from anybody else concerning something of less import would be unacceptable. If you don't like the law, then do something about it. If this is what you deem to be the best and most effective way to do that, I suggest you find a to become comfortable with it.
So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?
As is obvious, not all would.
Thanks, my friend, as you can see, Jito completely ignored the substance of my argument as it applies to the current american culture, as she responded to how it would apply to her personal life's credo. A more dishonest way of avoiding the meat of my argument couldn't be formed except by a manipulative, insincere and philosophical coward of jitobear's caliber. That's why there's nothing she wrote that's worth responding to. As usual she hasn't actually responded to anything I said. Why must these leftists twist what we say as they ignore the actual substance of it?
You not differentiating between the beaver and the beaver dam, the bird and the bird's nest or the man and the man's truck. The dams, nests and truck do not occur naturally...they are constructed by the naturally occuring animals using materials that occur in nature (albeit we have to smelt the iron and vulcanize the rubber whilst the birds and beavers just stick stuff together).
Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic.
So I have the choice between staying safe and then claiming insurance damages, or risking my life to kill a burglar and (likely) cause damage to my own property in the process?   Somehow, I'd rather stay safe. Better to lose my laptop than my life.
I'm afraid you're wrong, as I created you in my universe, and implanted in you a belief that you were a god. It lead you to make statements about the truth of your own beliefs, which I'm afraid are just self-beliefs with no real evidence.   Sorry.
What would you know about fair and balanced?   I know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?   And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?
I believe once you have the rights granted persons that they may not be taking away because you are asleep or in a coma. Not unless of course it can be shown that higher brain activity has ceased and there is no reasonable expectation that it could return.
Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish; take your pick Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier.
What other theories? Why mention them if you aren't going to explain them? You are actually on a board of education? I notice there was no mention of telling kids that there are other theories of gravity and that all of them have holes. Evolution is a more secure theory than gravity.
I see no reason why secular shows should be required to mention your mythology.
Oh, he doesn't want abortion, huh? If you take the Old Testament to be true, you just lied here.   Let's look, shall we?
Actually it couldn't be any worse then it is right now. More people historically have died at the hands of religious wars then non-religion. Religion has been used to push extreme political viewpoints, selfishness, racism, destruction of whole cultures, hatred, and ignorance. Wow that's something for you to be proud of eh grizzly6626? Through religion, televangelists have become pimps where cash is more important than integrity. While I haven't seen any atheists with bombs strapped to themselves, we've all see plenty of religious fools blowing themselves up each and every day. And of course we all know how peaceful and charitable The Spanish Inquisition was. I guess it's true, when it comes to religion IGNORANCE is bliss...   BTW - you forgot to mention that hitler was a devout catholic.   Yeah, like I said before, it couldn't be any worse then it is right now
But they are implemented completely differently.
The Sun was crucial in the evolution of most life on the planet, but it may not have been the main cause of the very beginning of life. There are hypotheses that energy necessary, chemical catalysts available, Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, but not Oxygen apart from being part of the Water molecule. There are tectonic activated hot springs and chimneys in the deep sea. There is an availability of Sulfur, heat energy, and the triggering of a Sulphur based metabolism. It was internal energy from up welling and down welling of hot magma which in turn was fuelled by core radioactivity. Some even speculate that the very centre of the core may be pure Uranium.   However, there is no need to debate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is a ruse by Magical Creationists who deliberately and in my opinion deceptively make Earth a closed entropy system.   Cuchulainn   PS: Fundies have an obligation to show why the fires of Hell are exempt from the 2nd Law. I already know the answer. Hell is imaginary and imaginary things do not gain entropy.
And when supersport says that the fossil record was created by god to test the faith of the people? He could make his hypothesis unfalsifiable, and he wouldn't care that it would be unscientific.
Well I'm glad its no problem for your son. No child deserves to be harrassed.
Whether or not the 2nd Amendment was written to provide for the protection of the States from a foreign invasion, or border dispute, or Civil War, it is clear that the objective of the 2nd Amendment is to address the basic provisions and control required to form a militia reporting to the President.   One of the provisions to form a militia is explicitly stated in the   2nd Amendment as the unrestricted Right of the individual to own guns.   At that time in our history, when a militia was formed, it was expected that individuals would bring their own gun(s) to the militia. That provision is THE IMPLICIT PURPOSE of the Right of the individual to own guns.   Within the 2nd Amendment, there are NO OTHER IMPLICIT, NOR EXPLICIT purposes pertaining to the unrestricted Right of the individual to own gun(s).   In other words, the 2nd Amendment does NOT IMPLICITLY, NOR EXPLICITLY suggest or expand its purpose beyond what it required for a militia, and the control of a militia.   The 2nd Amendment does NOT provide an individual the Right to own gun(s) for the PURPOSE OF providing for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..   Therefore, ANY OTHER PURPOSE OR REASON for the possession of guns that has been attributed to rights under the 2nd Amendment is based entirely upon thoughts and purposes that were NOT IN THE MINDS OF the Founding Fathers when the 2nd Amendment was written.   The Founding Fathers knew many people required guns to provide for food, income, and home-defense. Yet, the Founding Fathers did not separate the purpose of the unrestricted Right of individuals to own guns for a militia, from the SOLE PURPOSE of owning guns for the creation of a militia.   The Founding Fathers did not write the 2nd Amendment in a manner that   would even suggest that the Right of an individual to own guns had purposes beyond a militia, that would provide for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..   We may therefore conclude that, any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun, OTHER THAN for a militia, is not provided for under the 2nd Amendment, and that current gun laws for private ownership of guns is mistaken.   Justifications or reasons to provide individuals with a Right to own guns for a purpose or reason other than a militia, would have to be based on some Amendment, other than the 2nd Amendment, to determine if any such Right exists for individual gun ownership exists.   That the Founding Fathers did not write all Amendments with the explicit and specific Rights of individuals for every condition and circumstance is self-explanatory, as the size of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution would be enormous, and the Founding Fathers would still be busy writing the Bill of Rights and a Constitution if that was the case.   However, the Founding Fathers were very careful in their use of words and phrases, and in the logical composition of a Constitution, and that they decided not to specify other purposes exist that justify individual gun ownership, beyond a militia, in the 2nd Amendment. That decision would appear to be intentional.   Although it might ideal to understand all that the Founding Fathers had in mind, when the Constitution was written, it must also be understood   and concluded that what was the basis for a rational giving the Founding Fathers reasons to create an Amendment, and chose specific terms, phrases, and specifics, may not exist today, nor even be of any importance.   For example, individuals need not carry guns from their home to where our troops will gather. Today?s ?militia? provides for the a militia?s need, and an individual?s need for guns. What the Founding Fathers once wrote with respect to an individual possessing a gun for the purpose of a militia and the remainder of the 2nd Amendment requires revision or elimination.
I'm not surprised.   That's a typical response when someone calls your bluff.   Waxy
Muslims.
Oh dear God your ignorance is abundant!   Do you not understand what the federal DOMA law does?
Maybe He doesn't punish them.
From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that. Your clearly very wrong.
Well, now this is the question that really matters, and the answer is a long one. But to state it as simply as possible: denying same-sex marriage hurts many people. It forces same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages. It denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance, along with the many other benefits of marriage. It uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same-sex couples is wrong, and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society.   There is no reason to perpetuate these harms. I have heard many arguments opposed to same-sex marriage, but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms. In fact, I would even say that there is not one argument against same-sex marriage that makes logical sense at all. Thus, even if same-sex marriage brought no benefits, there would be no reason to keep it illegal; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone, unless it has a very good reason to. And there just isn't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.
What basis do fundamental rights derive from? In other words, how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right?
Yea that was uncle John!
Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other.
I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think that   the terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not aware   of any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris.
Why don't you just sum it up with "If you're not a fundamentalist Christian"?   You also fail to consider Christian agnostics.
No, it is not a bad deal for the child. However, my beliefs do not permit murder, even if it is a better "deal".
But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.
Our national parks are safe as is, huh? Regular people have no reason to feel to need to carry concealed weapons for their own protection, huh? How can you be safe when mexican drug cartel members are literally behind the next bush and inclined to kill you for stumbling upon their operation?
Because she, like every other political figurehead, thinks it's alright for her to carry a gun, but not anybody else.   If she DIDN'T support a ban on all firearms, then why did she say "If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them -- Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in -- I would have done it."
Oh I can easily spend $1,000 dollars an hour. If I could I would also have plenty of reason to live to be 114.
So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life. Care to give any examples, or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever?
I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. "Evolutionism" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?
Yes. The first one isolated was a frame-shift mutation on a plasmid. A fairly common source of useful mutations in bacteria.
Bonus question:   (Can you spot the grammatical error within the quoted text?)
You know, that sounds exactly what you are doing. I guess you are as foolish as they are.
If we were created in God's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of God's emotions. That our emotions are imperfect versions of his.   Of course I would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. And to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. An 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.
Because I don't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online. But for a quick summary: The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15% of caucasians, with 1% having the homogeneous version. These 1% are completely immune. The heterogeneous people possess some immunity.
This decision was not solely based on self, but then, I really don't give a if you want to call me selfish - the facts speak for themselves.
So, in other words, what you're saying is that the Pope, who just declared that all Christian Churches apart from the RCC to be false churches, including we evangelicals/fundamentalists is a fundie himself ? JPs right Matt, take your meds and do it quickly.
**   Actually it provided proof that RMNS doesn't explain the development of hands and feet, but I don't expect you to be able to understand that.
I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal. The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the “LIFE” of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk. When both lives are going to be lost, it is better to save one as opposed to losing two. The holocaust on the unborn children of this country is something that we should be ashamed of as a country.
How many opponents of liberal gun laws live in urban areas?
Really? A lot of people say that every answer makes more questions. In some ways we seem to know less now than we did at the time of Newton, in that we are less certain.   And Newton's laws deal with what happens in a vacuum with no resistance, not direct human experience   At any rate, my point is that you can't see all the evidence as piling up support for 'science' as 'science' is moulded to fit that evidence. Not a criticism of science, btw.
Such as?
How many court decisions have said that it is unconstitutional to regulate guns in any way?
How do you know none of the "children" were actually gang members engaged in illegal activity, and that fact was simply excluded because it wasn't considered newsworthy?
And yet you have no problem with this law Galileo?
Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.
I'm thinking this is the section of the Iowa Constitution the media will be talking about next:   Unlike California, amendments in Iowa must pass the legislature first (simple majority) before going to the voters. While I know little about the Iowa legislature, this seems a no brainer in a populace vote, considering previous votes and more current polls on this subject in Iowa. As a rule I lend polls very little credence, but DOMA passed by a wide majority in 1998. I doubt things have changed enough to cover the gap, a lot of traditional values and religious folks in Iowa.
Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at.
See above, please cite.
Well they'd be the experts on it; most of their members have been ruled as fitting under said category.   Let's face facts. Nobody who's in their right mind could actually believe the kind of nonsense they spread.
Are you trying to make a point here? Or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?   One of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. There's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. Instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   Kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with TV shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. Parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   We need massive reform. We gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s.
Obama overturns ban on overseas abortion funding   I thought abortion was the fix for bad or no family planning
This obviously depends on the person. Both are not good...once again, a comparision is not gonna work. Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic(not a real word) you will still mess up your health (which is a good reason we shouldn't have public health care).
You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt.
Pregnancy is a health issue only for the woman. Your glib remark pretending to sympathy is insulting.
But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.   But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural.
Well, Google is your friend here - try fossil and see what you get. Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins.   It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as "one big preservation event" and lots of "little preservations". If you can think of some examples of fossils then we can examine them more specifically as what can be said about the circumstances of their preservation.   I've been a bit vague here as it is a) such a broad subject to describe succinctly b) I'm tired and c) I'm full of cold   No doubt someone who isn't under the influence of b) and/or c) will chime in as well with more details while I pull round.   Now, where was my hankerchief......
The attacker is usually armed in spite of gun control laws. All they do is disarm the law abiding. Not to mention the lack of enforcement on criminals.
I'd say no to the first part, and yes to the second. The "information theory" argument is something that gets brought up on forums alot, generally by people who don't know what information theory is, but I've never seen an "official" ID person claim it as a central argument.   The basic argument is that stuff, from the universe, to people, to eyeballs, to DNA, is too complex to have "just happened". Someone, (and they won't say God, cause their not trying to be religious here, oh no...) must have designed them.
Because...
That is amazing.   I find it crazy that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of the babies that are aborted. Abortion is murder.
But still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.   What debate are you trying to end here? The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?
Assuming this right exists....you could say that you have no right to kill it though, you can only try to starve it.   -You have consented sex and get pregnant. The pregnancy is a direct consequence that was known when having sex.   -You have consented to a stranger coming into your house to eat dinner. The stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner.   -If you say you don't want the unborn to "live off you" anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now.   -You have decided the stranger must go, however, you don't have a right to kill him right there as you didn't give him any reasonable time to leave.
If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified. The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles. No elective, invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge.   If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents/ guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise, they wouldn't be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition.
As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think.
ur wierd!!!!!!!!!
Oh, don't be so hasty Bear in mind that at the scale upon which bacteria operate, molecules are significant physical structures. The bacterial flagellum, for instance, is an outboard motor constructed directly out of proteins, which are in turn directly, physically translated via RNA from DNA sequences. The physical shape of the folded molecular structure of those proteins is what makes the motor work. So there's nothing abstract about the relationship between DNA and the organism's physical form or abilities.
uh, yeah, that was their intent! Under color of law no less. The truth always seems to be your worst enemy doesn't it?
No, there really aren't. As for Robertson, why do you think I said he was right (as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible) by sheer luck?
That's a bad term. I wouldn't call myself that, but I do know more then average person.
Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.   Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.
No they don't. We didn't have a tyrannical society back in the 1830s when without a doubt personal autonomy didn't exist for some. The thing is, you don't have absolute personal autonomy now either. And it still doesn't answer my question about where the right came from, you just said there had to be one.
Sure you do . Because like any reprobate, what is wrong, is right to you; and what is right, is wrong to you. So of course you consider anything i believe to be wrong. But just so my original statement isn't lost to your attack, here it is again so it can be clearly interpreted without your tainted condemnation.   Archangel The ugly reality of life in America today regarding the secular humanist Left is that they support free speech as long as you agree with them. If you disagree with them, you are branded as a religious zealot who's determined to take their rights away. What they don't want you to ever realize is that it is they who are tearing at the traditions and customs that America was built upon and gained us the respect of the World at large. And it is their corruption of the morals and values America once represented that is the cause of so much hatred and disrespect from the rest of the World today.   So thanks to the liberal immoral left, we are seen as the moral evil of the World. Not because of the Religious Right as the Left would have you believe.
Well, by the strict defintion of the word "born", an abortion is considered a premature birth.
What else would you expect from the people who created a god in their own image?   Your thinking here is right, religion has a long history of being egocentric.
Actually I think most people DO realize this.
So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone. Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller. You brought up KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy) and you weren't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1" tall? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans?
Yes.
So you put words in Machs mouth. This would be acceptable if you were not doing it in a malicious fashion to get some sort of sadistic pleasure but you were instead actually trying to get him to explain himself. At any rate it totally disproves your nonsense about how you above me because you do not put words into peoples mouths because you do the same. You were not being dishonest to start with I admit it would be wrong to deliberately misrepesent you but neither of the circumstances apply here.
You know how those anti-gunners are?they just kinda get stuck in that same old revolving door.Can't come up with anything new so they rehash.
I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.
just re-emphasizing
Right. It was thrown out of schools back in the 1960s, and again in the 1980s when attempts were made to dress creationism up in the jargon of science and call it "Creation science."
Didn't supersport openly admit he could not prove his own beliefs in divine creation?   For all his dishonesty, you have to admit he's more honest and forthcoming then Marc or AA have been.
The Word of God says otherwise.   Romans 1:25-27 - They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised...   Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.   You've rewritten Biblical Christianity. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (New International Version) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
So it's the blog's fault that Miller sided with the creationists. Right-o, marc. (I suspect you haven't even read the blog entry in question; I'd be surprised if you've read more than a paragraph of PZ's blog.. ever.)
Hate to have to spoil things, but the rest of the world has really no interest at all in Kansas and its scholastic problems
And for good reason. Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with... electrical engineering. Examples: Walter ReMine, Fred Williams, etc.
Fetal Homocide? Toddler Homicide? A human in different stages of development.....Why/or What is the difference?And if someone wanted this legal( Toddler Homicide) ...I don't see much anybody could do legally to stop it..   When women kill their tots they are locked up/ and branded with a criminal record vs the female who callously kills durning the fetal stage.(Double standard?)   I have a couple friends, who have aborted more than once, because they didn't want to lose their girly figure(trivial). I find it eerie and disturbion.....
Well let's put it this way. I really like playing baseball. So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they're in a position where it will threaten their life. Since it's such a wonderful thing no one should have any problem with a law passed, right?
I say, since there are medical uses for the stuff, the drug is not pure harm (as the authoritarians assert.) Marijuana has its benefits and harms, and some of these benefits boil down to a matter of personal preference. Illegalizing it, in effect, dictates a personal preference.
Why are you against abortion?
I'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion. Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young. Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful.
Are you sure? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair. Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone.
1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.   3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.   4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html   Here is a time line of hominid species   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html   Evolution doesn't lead to a higher species, as well. There is no hierarchy in nature. Each species is equally as well "evolved" depending on it's environment etc.   A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp. Evolution doesn't lead to progression, but merely change. It's not getting better toward some high standard. Humans just like to think so.
This is a pretty touchy issue, and I agree with the different points of view.. most of them make sense... while I don't personally agree with abortion, I don't feel that I have the right to tell someone else what they should do. The way I see it, is that it's their body, their life, they are the ones who will be affected by their decision. I don't have to like the choices someone else makes, and I don't have to agree with it, but while I have that right, I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions. Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby, raising it, etc..??? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion. Maybe the woman was raped. I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that, and I agree with that, but the rape was committed against the woman's will... she didn't ask for that to happen, and if a pregnancy results from that, that is also against her will, so why should she feel that she has to have the child? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is?? The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis.... all I feel is until it happens to you, and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices, you shouldn't judge anyone else for the choices that they make.
I think you sound rather immature. And actually, it's tough luck for you, Chuzlife. Because the law is not on your side. And I doubt women who are exercising their Constitutional rights are going to tell you about what's going on with their bodies or within their privacy of their relationships with their physicians and/or family members.   Nor do I blame them one bit.   And just to clarify your position for the board, on this "child" definition you keep insisting on. Do you mean to use that terminology for a fertilized egg, too?   As in the photograph I shared earlier?   :flutteringeyelashes:
I got an interesting tid bit for you:   http://www.2ampd.net/Articles/difiElitist.htm   First read the text. The anti-gun senator is noted for having the ONLY legal concealed gun in the city of San Francisco.   Also note as a person who carried a concealed gun and still keeps a .357 magnum for protection, that she should KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER, until your aming at your target.
http://www.dcagenda.com/2010/02/08/m...asure-in-poll/   Keep in mind that this is an opinion poll, so take it for what its worth, but it seems to indicate that the people of DC wanted to vote on this issue.
No, I'm saying it's OK because abortion is legal in this country. I was just pointing out that it's also legal to execute a convicted killer, and it's fine and dandy to declare wars where many people will die. "Thall shalt not kill, unless there is a war".   Legally there is a difference. But let's just toss that out for a second. The end result is exactly the same. Eyes fogged over no longer care whether it was fun or self defense.   It's only time it's your call, is when it's suicide.
Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.
It is clearly not a strawman argument. I think he doesn't know what "straw man" means and I think he is meaning to say "red herring."   It isn't a red herring either; it's a perfectly logically related question. I would guess he doesn't see that as he neither understands evolution nor bacterial resistance and, thus, the relationship.
Yes. Only the ignorant think not.
again, please review the definition of an atheist   humor cannot be observed by apparatus that test the physical realm. it is an abstract and intangible quality. so is beauty, artistic ability and pleasure. yet these things exist and are as real to an atheist as it is to a theist. an atheist does not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible qualities or account for their existence. they can be detected through mental processing, and communicated so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it is present.   being an atheist does not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract things. it just precludes the belief in god and a spiritual/supernatural realm
This is obviously not talking about abortion.
These items do not have killing as their primary use.
No. You've not understood what I said. I don't know how to make it perfectly clear to you...the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100% of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not.
You can not create the general from the specific, only the specific from the general
I'll assume this is figurative since they do not literally melt.
Well, if you don't want a reaction, I would prefer if you not use the word "god" since it is loaded with so many other meanings and conotations than those you say you mean.   The choice between our two stances is indeed one between choosing a moral stance based on reasoned analysis (imperfect as that may be) and choosing a moral stance based on blind faith (i.e. not supported by evidence) in a moral code dictated by a religious authority.   You say that my moral code is a code that puts faith only in myself. That is not true. I very openly acknowledge that if I never had input from the outside - moral codes which were presented to me with the reasons behind them - then my moral code as determined solely by myself would have been meager indeed. I have had a wide range of influences which have helped determined my moral code:   - The moral codes of my folks during my upbringing   - The moral code of the moderate form of Roman Catholicism I grew up with   - The moral codes generally accepted by the moderate Democratic part of society   - The moral stances of friends   - The moral philosophy of Kant and other philosophers I have read about   I am sure that I could even come up with more than that. From all of those, I have gleaned a morality that works best for me, where my moral code seems to be quite a common one. The moral rules which I accepted were typically the ones which gave the reasons behind them and whose base assumptions I agreed with. The moral rules which I rejected were typically the ones which gave no supporting reasons or whose base assumptions I disagreed with. I suspect that you assume that if a morality is not grounded in religious rules, then it becomes based on selfishness. That is not true. We are all inspired by heroes that sacrifice themselves for others - be they secular or religious (as Jesus himself can be viewed as a hero).   There is a lot of overlap in morality between secular morality and religious (mainly Christian) morality - against theft, murder, etc. However, I find too many of the religious rules very arbitrary (such as the anti-Gay propaganda, some religion's ban on contraceptives, the idea of the infalibility of the pope, etc.) that I certainly will not follow religious rules blindly. Furthermore, so much of religious morality was determined simply by religious men who were set in the local morality of their time and attached that morality to the religion. Even if Jesus was divine, it would be very hard today to know how to throw away all the junk morality that was added after his time and extract the pure origin.
As pointed out, with a different physics, chemistry and biology, the universe as we know it wouldn't exist. What is really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth is a list of what we should expect if a flood had occurred under the same laws of science that are in operation today. One problem with creationism (I know, you want to ignore the problems) is that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bumps into scientifically impossible events.   I don't mean to rain on the parade, but with all that said, it has been done. There is a list of 28 items, originally compiled by Jim Moore, that we should find if the flood happened as per the Bible. Not even miracles can solve these. That list is followed by further problems that have been compiled by Ken Harding from numerous sources.   What Would We Expect to Find if the World Had Flooded   For more information you can refer to the Flood Geology FAQs at TO. Two items with information that specifically addresses the question of the OP are Problems with a Global Flood, and The Geologic Column and its Implications for the Flood .
Are there truly laws of logic?   Where are they encoded?
The quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it's mount. This is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern. This pattern along with tracer rounds helps the shooter guide the blizzard of bullets at the aircraft. Even this only works at low altitudes. Modern planes typically fly at ~30K feet. That's more than 5 miles high! A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps. The odds of hitting something that is moving at ~900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~2800fps are slim to none. That is why anti-aircraft guns are full auto, not a semiauto or anything that a citizen has access to legally.
you're looking at evolution in way too much of a magical and mystical way. Evolution doesn't "know" anything. It doesn't have any desires... and... i lack the eloquence to briefly state mechanical (and complete lack of desire) aspects of evolution. i suggest you do research as to how there are no conscious thinking elements in evolution.   Science will never be able to disprove any god because of some flaw science happens to point out. The best individuals can do is, when people try to reason that such perfect organs imply a designer, point out that the design isn't all that perfect after all.   If you want to try and debate flaws in design are evidence against a god... well go ahead... but then i'll just know if i'm ever looking for an easy debate victory i'll just try to find you. At the very best all you are doing is showing that the idea that God created all things perfectly probably isn't true... and even then someone can just point out that apparent flaws we see are simply the ineffable will of god.
Actually, no, that is not what I said. I said:   What you quoted is what Answers in Genesis said. Please do not be dishonest and tell others that I said this as I did not.
Ingus, please see my comments at the end of my previous post.   The purpose of this thread is to introduce ourselves and have a Q&amp;A about the basis for each others views etc.   If you want to debate the specific differences we may have in our views, either open a new thread and invite me over, challenge me, whatever...   But I'm not going to debate it here.   I think this thread is a great idea.   People should introduce themselves, lay out their views however they see fit and let others do the same.
And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy, the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller. Doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold.
Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals.
No, that's just the pork tacked onto the original bill.
They do not hate the concept, they merely reject it as being useful or necessary to explain the material universe. I mean come on what utility would a physics which incorporated miracles be? Nothing would be predictable and all utility would be lost. If you want all of science to be arbitrary and unreliable then all ya gotta do is inject miracles into the field.   For example what value is f=ma {except when the diety wills otherwise}.   Or e=mc2 (god willing)
So let me get this straight - you admit that you are wrong, and you want me to provide documentation to prove this admission correct?   How about we both simply agree that you were wrong and move on.
So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, "Lord Jesus, help me". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing. There was nobody there at all, no human anyway.
The founding fathers were afraid to trust the common people with the right to vote. They didn't want mob rule and chaos. "Most of the Founders believed that property ownership was essential to good citizenship and therefore that only property owners should be able to vote. 'Property', in those days, also included slaves, of course, and half of the Founders were slave owners....The maintenance of power in the hands of the elite was further strengthened by who could vote. In 1787, there were about four million people living in the 13 original states. But only about four percent of them, it is estimated, could vote. Excluded were the one million slaves, the two million women, anyone under the age of 21, and all non-property owners."   http://www.alternativesmagazine.com/22/lonsdale.html
You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples.
To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.   Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted). Forced contraception/abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world...
What a condescending attitude you have. In case you haven't noticed, you are a very small part of the human race that you smuggly hold in contempt. (Thankfully small!) Your mission should be to improve it, not to stand back and claim you are better than everybody else, as you seem to do.   Killing innocent people of any age is wrong. Children are no exception, they are just the epitomy of innocence.   The "pretty sick" applies to your own deluded thoughts.   Rest assured, I will not mourn your death or the deaths of any of those you may have taught your insane values. You are  !

Well, sort of. It isn't necessary, but if you're predicting intelligence from what someone does rather than direct measurements of physical properties, knowing their motivation level might allow you to make more accurate predictions.   Nevertheless even without knowing the subjects' motivations at all, today's generic intelligence tests still have excellent predictive power for success in both school and employment, and are perhaps better predictors for future success than any other method we have (including interviews, personality inventories, aptitude in a particular field)
Just a newly-evolved structure. It happens.
ABORTION IS NOT BAD.   That's all that needs to be said.
An attempt by you to dodge the main point.
You really have flipped over the edge into the desparate area of insanity.   Please Penfold present some STATISTICS to back up your wild accusations. IF you cannot present anything other than the disgraceful 43..... Then shut up   Guns in the hands of law abiding citizens save lives, the statistics back this up from EVERY country EVER to introduce gun control.
So the founding fathers and their work is basicy viewed as an authority based on their competence?
Intellignet design seems to have a large following. The fact that somebody believes in intellient design does not necessarily mean that they disagree with evolution. A lot of folks (I would say the majority) view it as evolution used as a vehicle for intellient design (basically "god planned it and made it all happen").   The movement to teach YEC is non existant. Creationism does not necessarily=YEC. The YEC crowd is their own little clique of scientific illiterates. I have been on the local board of education for 2 years now and have never heard the phrase "Young Earth Creationists" in any official capacity, nor has anybody ever suggested that it be taught. I had no idea what a "young earth creationist" was until I read it on this board, 6 months ago. It is simply not an issue, and I am right in the middle of Kansas.
Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. The reason I say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. Kinda just says that there are other people out there.
Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems.
How curious that not everyone can admit that this kind of treatment is wrong. How interesting that another issue comes up instead of addressing the blatant, in-your-face kind of mistreatment of an individual making a private, personal decision.   Like many decisions in life, this is one that is difficult to come to. It doesn't mean it's a wrong one. It's hard because your options are so very serious.

Yes, I've noticed that. I do think part of the problem is that he hasn't bothered to get educated in the subject. From the arguments I've seen from him over the time he's been here he seems to rely on YEC websites for information, and when he gets to something he doesn't know it seems like he cuts-and-pastes (often without fuly reading) from google (leading to the Civil War Dinosaur fiasco and the Nazca stones fiasco) that seems to support his views
Oh sinj.don't let it get you down,it don't mean nothing   (sorry couldn't help it)
It is in the first place unclear to whom the "further harm" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different.
You're thinking is right on, sinjin.   Although it's kinda hush-hush, it has been determined (especially in the more charismatic churches) that when one "goes further" in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out. A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is &#8220;left behind&#8221; feel closed out and closed off. Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the &#8220;right thing&#8221; according to that religion, followed all too often by divorce.
Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.
And so have animals. Plants have been wiped out in the great extinctions too.   [quote]Carbon dioxide producing animals could even feed themselves with their own breathe![/quot]   Huh? You produce carbon dioxide. How do you propose to feed yourself with that?
What in the Hell does evolution have to do with people doing bad things? I am a believer in creation by God and have never heard such drivel. BOY-HOWDY!!!
Right. The frenquecy of the alles have changed over time.
and thus a reason to support balanced reporting.   true, there are indisputable facts. say 3000 died.   but the interpretation of the facts are subjected to bias. the 3000 deserved to die as collaborators vs the 3000 were innocent and did not deserve to die.
I know that not all people who are pro-life are woman-hating. I, too want to see abortion reduced to the bare minimum. I just disagree with most pro-lifers on how to accomplish that.   My issue was with ROCC's attitude in the post I was responding to. To summarize he/she said that your shouldn't get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it. There is absolutely no regard for an individual's situation, the attack is entirely focused on women and it offers NOTHING that will help reduce abortion.   ROCC's statement was quite woman-hating, but no, it is not indicative of the pro-life side's feelings about women. The only times I am compelled to really think pro-lifers are anti-woman is when they have the "pregnancy is a woman's due punishment for promiscuity" attitude or demand that a woman die/put her health jeapardy or demand rape victims go through with pregnancies. If you can't see the woman in even those most extreme situations, then you clearly have zero regard for women.   I believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort. To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, or gauarantee responsible choices. It will lead desperate women to desperate action, though (i.e., coat hangers).
A perfect example of why Christian fundamentalismm and evolution can't co-exist. If God is wrong, then the Bible is wrong. Evolution contradicts the Bible, plain and simple.
so do we trash the whole thing, or what?
Everything basically.   You're held captive by hostile natives that have set up barricades and checkpoints around the property you live on. They decide when you get to come in and go out, and the police have decided to abandon you rather than come to your aid. And Canada has laws that make defense with a firearm either impractical or out right illegal depending on just where you life.
Our emphasis on Police and crime fighting reduced crime. Not gun control!   Our murder rate is largely an Inner City drug and drug gang related problem. Fix that and then you will finally be doing something!
Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made "morals and ethics" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men.
Your wrong. Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres.
The main incentive for a male child is that in China you can only have one child without severe penalties and a female child means the family name is lost.
We know that now, but not because the sun rises every day, because we have identified other evidence that proves heliocentrism.   The hypothesis "the sun orbits the earth" predicts it will rise and set every day, the hypothesis "The earth is rotating" predicts the same.
Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago (a real cave, not one of the commercialized ones). Bats actually have better eyesite than humans, but even they can't see in pitch black. No eye can.
Thanks. But it seems that you don't understand. Perhaps the people of Austin are more intelligent than they are down here in Houston. Maybe it's just that you are surrounded by educated people who show a tendency away from creationism. But you see, I run into people all the time (and meet them on this board too) who think that speciation has never been observed. Why do they think that? Because their holy book tells them so. The herring gull/lesser black-backed gull is an example of a single, vast, globe encircling population that has become separate species at the extremes of it's range - and those extremes overlap. Before I came to Texas the idea that the Book of Genesis was literally true never occurred to me. So it was kind of a neat moment to realize that the big birds around the restaurant dumpster were herring gulls, a living example of a population in the process of forming separate species.
**   Nor do I think you at all stupid. I do not debate stupid people, there is no challenge in it. Nor do I debate arrant foolishness and irrational notions such as biblical literalism. It's no more challenging than shooting fish in a barrel, and no more satisfying than destroying a child's faith in the tooth fairy.   But I do take offence at you characterizing my ability to reason logically and to think with some originality as being nothing more than 'manipulation' and sophistry.
Please define complexity. Please define information. Both definitions should be relevant to biology.
The counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the Violinist arguments, at the very least. Whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story :P
Hmm . . . funny, I don't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world. What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed (in the form of a generalization) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as "unbelievably" hard to go through, or a "life threatening condition" like malignant cancer. You didn't qualify it by saying "some" pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not "unbelievably hard to go through"--she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you.   What you did was use unfounded generalizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about.
It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers. To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous.
Sure, here ya go...   Radiocarbon Dating
yes, on the grounds of "mostly likely" we can make reasonable assumptions. but we must still treat them as such.   part of the catch of God's existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found. if Jesus actually physically performed observable miracles, even 2000 years ago, then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does (or did) exist in reality. however, even jesus's ministry contradicts the faith theory. how can God expect faith from those who haven't observed on the grounds of those who have? if people can observe the manifested power of God in reality, then they have physical evidence that God exists. but this conflicts with the nature of God from a biblical standpoint. in other words, the bible cannot claim that physical evidence for the existence of God can exist, and then that it cannot exist, without contradicting itself. what we end up with is the predicament that ANY physical evidence that could possibly support God's existence is evidence against God's existence (at least from a biblical standpoint)
Uh...yeah? Is there some other way than evolution this can happen? Evolution encompasses speciation which results from evolution taking different paths when populations are separated by some factor in their environment or geographically.   Are you saying you believe that the species have all somehow resulted from a common genome yet at the same time rejecting evolution as an explanation?
I don't see how one can be a agnostic and be a Deist either. Deism requires a origin, some form of a clockmaker. To not be sure that such a being exists is to fail one of the most basic ideas of Deism.
Clearly this is true. There are a multitude of denominations from every religion. This is as specially true with Christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done. Baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion. The Church of Christ believes one must baptize in the name of Jesus, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost thing was while Jesus lived. Because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church, some believe the art must stay in the church.   Most of the complications to Christianity is simply because the followers really believed Jesus would return. No one wrote a book on the Religion.   The Religion changed a great deal through time. King James was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to.   One letter spoke of the sin of Slavery. This was clearly at odds with King James. Other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and I'll let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws.
believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless
And the mall plainly had "no guns allowed" signs displayed at all the entrances, meaning the shooter broke the law when he brought his gun in and started shooting.   Now, find me a school massacre that took place where concealed carry is actually legal on campus.
And...   You're still left with the simple fact that the Declaration of Independance, the premise of your hierarchy of rhetoric, is not legally relevant to the government of the U.S.   The constitution was written after the declaration. Had they wanted to include wording from the declaration, they could have, yet they didn't, did they?   Your house of cards is built on a rhetorical slight of hand, trying to persuade by implying somehow that abortion being legal, which it is, in the U.S., right now, should not be allowed.   TIP: Trying forming a reasoned argument without such a weak premise, else, your entire argument is just as flawed, which it is.   Abortion is legal, for the right reasons.   A conscious, human, U.S. citizen, has rights.   Cells, without consciousnes, that are not citizens, do not have rights, are not individuals, and are not humans.   You can jump up and down, and post irrelevant things such as the Dec. of Independance, but it doesn't boost your debate credibility.   -Mach
No I don't . I want children (at least my children and family) to be placed in a school where they do not have to worry about one of their classmates pulling out a tech 9 and going on a rampage in the library. I don't think that is too much to ask. I think eliminating the risk of this makes a school a much more effective place to learn. How many people do you think actually learned anything at Columbine the day they came back to school, or perhaps were they a little distracted. I'm all for the government giving you and like-minded extremists your own school (hell, even your own state...why not) and letting you all carry guns into schools and every other place you want to. As long as when a gunfight breaks out at your school in Rottencrotch Nebraska, I don't have to see all the parents on TV crying and bawling about how could this tragedy happen here, and saying that something should have been done, this never should have happened. I think there is a time and place for guns, but I don't think that guns belong in schools.
And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible.

Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes.
Actually, after the fact calculations on either side are just noise. Humans do exist and I suspect that all statements of probabilities are incorrect. Further, I don't think that coin flips are relevant and not even a very good analogy.
Different sort of penetration, so no.
This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising "proofs" if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, "explain" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the   predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?   Ecclesiastes 1:6   The wind goes toward the south,   And turns around to the north;   The wind whirls about continually,   And comes again on its circuit.   How did they know that the earth "hangs on nothing" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?   Job 26:7   He stretches out the north over empty space;   He hangs the earth on nothing.   How did they know that the "vapors" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?   Jeremiah 10:13   When He utters His voice,   There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:   ?And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.   He makes lightning for the rain,   He brings the wind out of His treasuries.?   Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC?more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.   Genesis 7:11   In the six hundredth year of Noah?s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.   Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.   The story goes "They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along."
Well try Arkansas (75/25), Georgia (76/24), Kentucky (75/25), Michigan (59/41), Mississippi (86/14), Montana (67/33), North Dakota (73/27), Ohio (62/38), Oklahoma (76/24), Oregon (57/43), and Utah (66/34).   All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the "religious right" feel the same way.

Just a guess on my part. But it's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan, etc.   Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized, inhumane act, about to take place, is somehow civilized or humane. And not the bloodthirsty, venomous, purely vengeful thing that it is.   He sounds like a very principled individual to me. With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable. Not only for moral reasons, but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent, and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable, under our American Constitution, often punishing everyone involved, even the families of victims. (i.e. These cases go on for years and years and years and years. There's no closure for people.)
Oh I hated being pregnant. However I am not really arguing whether pregnancy in and of itself is punishment, I suspect that is an opinion matter - there are some crazy women who actually liked pregnancy. Julie - however clearly feels that it is acceptable to use a pregnancy and parenting in a punitive matter against women she feels are irresponsible.
Not this time. That was the previous attempt by the good people of Kansas.
Can't your religion survive a little mockery?   On the other hand I can understand why your worried your religion being so ridiculous and all.
Please explain this statement.
A more precise term would be "broaden," since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, "diluted" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only "change" would be to other people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only "change" in that regard will be the fact that they are encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.   The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.
Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.
Yes, the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards!!   If you hate your job that much, quit. You aren't being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something. If you don't like it, don't do it. If you hate trade, you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots.
Well, here's another quote from Allan Feduucia:   "Feathers are unique to birds, and no known structure intermediate between scales and feathers has been identified." (J. Alan Feduccia, The Age of Birds, Harvard University Press, 1980, pg. 52)   Sounds contradictory to me!

Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
No but the fact that infants have brain activity makes them a world of difference between a zygote that has no brain activity. They can think and feel and exhibit all the characteristics of other human beings. A zygote exhibits none of those characteristics.
So sorry, Anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. And now, using that excuse? What!   If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again. Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.   There are some who need to be put to death.   Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. I could very well be in prison myself.
Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything. From religions to morals and scientific progression. Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally didn't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active. If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy
Oh sorry, I didn't understand what you were asking.   Ok, what I think happened {Like Tasyfish hinted at} was that Moses recorded what god told him or Genesis 1 because it is in more detail, and Genesis 2 is what was passed down through Noah, in Oral history, so it would differ slightly, but that's becaue of man's error, not God's.
Fossils are evidence, not theory. They can be used in the construction of any theory, including creationism. Whether this is 'just' or not, is another issue. I point this out as many seem confused about evidence, and think that it just points to something without interpretation
What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E.

http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD011.html   Radiocarbon dating has been repeatedly tested, demonstrating its accuracy. It is calibrated by tree-ring data, which gives a nearly exact calendar for more than 11,000 years back. It has also been tested on items for which the age is known through historical records, such as parts of the Dead Sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb (MNSU n.d.; Watson 2001). Multiple samples from a single object have been dated independently, yielding consistent results. Radiocarbon dating is also concordant with other dating techniques (e.g., Bard et al. 1990).
This claim might be true, but do you have any citations about Carl Burgh's fraudulent claims? (ps I note you don't tell everyone else to go look up a book!

And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?
But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not. It's prejudice, pure and simple, and you're no exception. Now, one would think, being the supposedly non-Christian enlightened person you are, you would simply say "oh, I didn't realize that my posts came across as anti-Christian sometimes, and that it indicates a prejudice on my part, and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking." I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking.
Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.
And rightfully so.
Actually, for his hypothesis to explain the difference, he would have to say that the DNA changed. Even so, he assumes more.
Proof that evolution is "right" is not necessary to prove that Genesis is not science. Genesis is an inspired poem, and contains truth in its message, but it is pretty obviously a work of poetry, like a song. Look at the repetition, and all the metaphors! Poetry does not imply fiction. THere are many historically valid poems. Plus, when read figuratively, Genesis poses no conflict at all with science.   Evolution is not the only science that demonstrates Genesis can not be read literally. What about the speed of light from the stars, geology, genetics, comparative embryology, etc. The only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation. For most of us Faith and science work together!   see: songofgenesis.org for more detailed information.
We already accept that it is. You don't have to convince us.   However, consider what this does to your argument that natural selection is random.
So, because they don't interpret the bible as you do, they believe that there are no deities? That is what you said...
You stand up for women..   I stand up for the child who has no choice   Who's being descrimatory here?
Evidence or proof for that delusion?
Should free speech require registration?
I'm not sure what the source of the bias would be. Do you mean that it is somehow prejudicial to link ID with creationism, because, somehow ID is scientific while creationism isn't? But that's just not true. In the Dover case the court concluded that ID isn't science any more than creationism is. In fact, it was clearly demonstrated that the motivation for ID is an effort to disguise the fact that it is nothing more than creationism without the mention of god. Basically, if you scratch an IDer, you get a creationist.
That should be, "duh".   I knew what you meant. A bit of humor is ok.   But I guess you don't have anything to say about the implications of this study.
You know, I would be fine with that as long as it were truly a middle ground. If that term were used equally among straights as well as gays.   But it's just a term. The same as with the term "marriage."   It's just a term. Just a word.   Personally I feel the government needs to get out of the business of marriage altogether.   Let the legal term be agreed upon unilaterally.
Well, it depends on your definition of retarded I guess. The standards to get a drivers license are really not that high. Think of how dumb the average person is, and realize that 50% of people are dumber than that. Kinda makes you cringe.   And you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident? Well, perhaps the fact that I am a concientious, defensive, and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road. Maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me, I should just throw my hands in the air and scream "take the wheel jesus!" I am sure some magical being will fly down from heaven and save me from crashing. Yeah...sure.
Then you freely admit that you lied when you said this, and I quote: People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.   AND   Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, I mean, how is accurately quoting passages from the bible distorting it in any way? You do nothing but post drivel which makes no factual statements at all. And you call that debating?
Don't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in. I'm not that easily fooled.
But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.
What I find hard to believe is that politicians will place their decision above the right to life of a human person only for political expediency.
Again, we never said that a human fetus was a different species.
Just so you know, the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants.
Rahm Emanuel for one. He seems to sum up the message very well.   And then there's Carolyn McCarthy who actually introduced the bill that, if passed into law, would cancel your Second Amendment rights just because your name is on the no fly list.   Just two names, perhaps, but they're the names of people in a very powerful and dangerous position, capable of making very bad things happen.
Oh, I LOVE semantics games
Believe me, marc, we certainly can. The fact that it damns your argument is no skin off our backs. In fact, it damns your argument so much that the producers know it. See below.
Actually your posts are providing increasing evidence for just how simple folks can get.
Well, the first part is true but I'm not sure I understand what you are saying in the second part. Science does not claim that intelligent design is false because science lacks the tools to examine the concept. ID is just another unsupported assertion outside the domain of science (and logic for that matter). ID has reached the stage of unsupported assertion without evidence. Science has better explanations.
Yes. I believe it's a matter of personal individual freedom.   If purchased legally, and not used to commit a crime, what harm comes from handgun ownership? I don't own one, but I own many other guns. If they can ban handguns, what's to stop them from banning shotguns, or even BB guns?   I don't believe in a nanny state, taking away my toys "for my own good".   Waxy
Prove it. Got any credible scientific or sociological studies? NOPE, ya don't. Didn't think so.
But is the Red Cross Christian? Obviously most contributors are Christian. That's obvious as most Americans are Christian.
And these are psalms, which are just popular prayers rather than the word of God arn't they?   Rather than go with the slightly bizarre 'well you're not King David are you...' type response, I could see it being fairly reasonable that God 'knows' people who are born. He might 'know of' the various individuals who are misscarried, die at birth or are aborted but what exactly does he know in relation to them?   Do our souls have their own personalities completely seperate from our mortal ones that are shaped as much by our souls as genes and experience - or does God 'know' them through the billions of other possible universes, i.e he knows them from somewhere/when they didn't die. But if that counts then that means our souls are spread out over an infinite number of copies of us. If so then surely the threat of Hell is irrelevant, either we are doomed because clearly some version of reality has us being evil (I've seen enough TV shows to know that this is pratically 100% certain.) or the soul is something seperate from us and our actions?
Just because you don't have a handle on what civil rights are doesn't make the phrase arbitrary. It's a legal term, not a catch phrase. I'm not a lawyer, I couldn't track down the exact definition they use in Massachusetts, but rest assured they have one.
And yet the atheist belief system allows for everyone to have their own seperate set of morals. According to the Atheist system, what Hitleror Stalin did was perfectly moral because those atheists believed that what they were doing was moral. Disgusting if you ask me.
But didn't they tell you? They outsourced your job to me!
I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard.
This is retarded. A species would be defined by the genome, not which organs work the way they are supposed to or not.
It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.
the blog is just the link for the article....geez, get a grip.
It varies. Sometimes elementary/middle school kids and sometimes older minors like high school kids. I not talking about gangbangers if this is where you're going.
You know they are having a fit,and when everyone see's the streets aren't running red maybe more states will pick it up and follow.
Because most people are Christian.
wrong again,   only 154 justifiable homicides out of thousands of murders   * In 2005, 30,694 people in the United States died from firearm-related deaths – 12,352 were murdered; 17,002 killed themselves; 789 were accidents; 330 died by police intervention, and in 221, the intent was unknown. 6 In comparison, 33,651 Americans were killed in the Korean War and 58,193 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War.7   * An additional 71,417 people were shot and survived their injuries -- 52,748 people injured in an attack; 3,190 people injured in a suicide attempt; 14,678 people shot accidentally, and 801 people shot in a police intervention.8   * In 2004, firearms were used to murder 56 people in Australia, 184 people in Canada, 73 people in England and Wales, 5 people in New Zealand, and 37 people in Sweden.9 In comparison, firearms were used to murder 11,344 in the United States.10   * In 2006, there were only 154 justifiable homicides by private citizens using handguns in the United States.11   * For every time a gun is used in a home in a legally-justifiable shooting [note that every self-defense is legally justifiable] there are 22 criminal, unintentional, and suicide-related shootings.17   * The presence of a gun in the home triples the risk of homicide in the home.18   * The presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold.19
Sorry, sometimes sarcasm is quite hard to read.
Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.
Since when were proteins no longer structures? A basic freshmen tool for teaching is the phrase "structure defines function."
Not knowing isn't the same as claiming magic.
We can add to this list, Singin's desire of criminalizing gun owners who don't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts. He of course says that does not mean jail, but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time. and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms. So we are talking about Very Serious jail terms regardless of what Sinjin might say in order to sell the idea. And one more thing the Anti-gun forces want but won't say it now.
So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?
Actually, that story was an invention after the fact. It never happened. At least that is what the witnesses who were there said. Why do christians feel that it is OK to invent such stories to support their point? Isn't that lying? Isn't lying wrong?
I'm glad to see you've finally come around.
I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it.
But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the "discrimination" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ...   Anyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha. The deliberately out-of-context quotes again that directly contradict the conclusions of the authors.
Well, that just means I'm a more capable lump of cells now than I was when I was first conceived. I started doing what most embryos do when they are first formed, and that is develop. I'm still developing. I can't seem to stop it. I think my body has stopped growing (in height anyway), but seem to keep filling my brain with more and more experience.   The point I was trying to make is that since there is a continuum of existence between conception and death, there is no line you can draw (save birth, which may or may not be considered an arbitrary boundary to personhood) that would constitute some sort of a change in what you are.   I started as one cell and continued to grow and develop, which I am still doing now. If I am a person now, I was a person when I was the zygote.   If we are going to talk about aortion in this society we should be honest about it and not try to mince words when it come to killing a baby. I'm not "anti-choice" but I think we should honestly recognize that an embryo is a living human individual that dies when it is aborted. That thought turns most people off so they have to make themselves believe that an abortion is not a killing since the embryo wasn't a person. Logically, it is a killing. A life was ended. The question then becomes, is it murder? I don't happen to think that, but it is really quite subjective anyway.
So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.
Among the icons (idols) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme. It is the myth of evolution. We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin, the high priest of natural selection. Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism (minute changes over eons) all life arose out of a primordial soup.   Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety. The reason that life must be derived from life (biogenesis) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen. "You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth" as Newton said. Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life. This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal, it all has to happen all at once.   One more thing, evolution is a biogenesis theory and actual evidence for abiogenesis is rare and fragmentary just as it is for every other aspect of the single common ancestor model.
Then why does the following occur?
That clearly went whooshing over your head.   It was intended to mock the OP. (Interesting "new" bibilical revelation, indeed.)   I don't put any credence in silly comparisons like the trite Kennedy/Lincoln litany that arose in the 60's or the similarly absurd list that INRI posted. They both demonstrate how one can concoct meaningless comparisons in an attempt to invent a non-existent connection between two unrelated events.   It is the same for all "prophesies".
On what grounds do you seek to redefine the institution of marriage from it's accepted standard in this country?
Prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative Christian rather than a conservative Republican OP. Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together.
Really? The first description is of a Hippo? Here's a picture of a Hippo charlie: http://www.dkimages.com/discover/pre...0/90065521.JPG   Now tell me how this fits the description of the behemoths tail? I quote:   Job 40:15-24 (New International Version)   15 "Look at the behemoth, [a]   which I made along with you   and which feeds on grass like an ox.   16 What strength he has in his loins,   what power in the muscles of his belly!   [b]17 His tail sways like a cedar;   the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.   18 His bones are tubes of bronze,   his limbs like rods of iron.(In Hebrew, this literally reads, “he lets hang his tail like a cedar.”)A Cedar is not a tiny insignificant tree as the hippos tail is when compared to other tails on other animals. You insult the intelligence of the ancients to imply that they couldn't either name or describe a hippo by name which as you yourself admit, was a common animal in that part of the world.   As for Leviathan being a crocodile or an alligator, again, are you telling me that their hides are invulnerable to arrows or spears and cannot be punctured at all? Would those animals stand firm and not flee from men who stood up to them with spears, javelins and arrows? Not on your life.   “Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.
Object to the woman being required to remain pregnant when she does not want to be.
I think your idea has merit. However, before I would fully endorse it, I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law.
The article said very little about his observations and almost nothing about his methods.
Thanks, Clive, you're a good sport. Of course I can't agree with the XXXXX part. Rash, unwise, unknowledgeable, maybe, but not fools.
I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?
At 13 - abortion, unless she is uniquely physically advanced. It's incredible how many men are sure being pregnant is no big deal....   Steve - regarding whether she can consent to abortion.   Technically I don't think a minor can consent to either sex or abortion in any state (unless emancipated). I know that is how it is in Minnesota. I am sure the laws vary from state to state.   Medical decisions generally fall to the parents.   I know whether minors should have access to abortion without parental notifications is a controversial issue. On the surface one would think, of course not - but there is concern for those girls who are in abusive situations at home. And as I told VOR, if I had a daughter bound and determined not to tell me, I would rather she have access to safe abortion than resort to something drastic.   A baby pregnant - yikes. Personally I think it's innapropriate and dangerous for a little girl to carry a pregnancy to term. But I would sure love to simply avoid it through better prevention. I do not think an abortion would be anything but scary for her either - but technically, at that age, it would be safer.   Steve - in no way, shape or form is a 13 year old ready for this - not physically, mentally or emotionally - not for pregnancy, and certainly not for parenting. I have a neices that old - good gracious - no way!
Actually, selection occurs by differential reproductive rates. What this means is that organisms which reproduce more will have more offspring than the others (obviously). Therefore, traits that help organisms reproduce will become more prevailant.
Do you want something other than peppered moths, bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics, Darwin's finches, and the other species of the Galapagos?   Maybe biologists are not allowed to do tests on animals that will kill many of them. This reminds me of Kent Hovind's reward for evidence of evolution: impossible to fulfill.
From that site:
So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. You just want it used judiciously? Same here. Where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously.
Oh? Don't you think that since Jesus said that whosoever so much as hated their brother without a cause is a murder?   Or are you Jewish and don't believe the New Testament? Is that why you say the Bible says nothing about abortion, or just plain killing at all?
No I do not say that the creation of energy and matter   did not coincide the creation of the laws that govern/regulate   them. What I say is that the laws are not the RESULTS of the   existence of energy, matter etc.
In a way, taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it. For instance, we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights. Here are just a small number that come to mind:   1) Right to murder   2) Right to own slaves   3) Right to rape   4) Right to abusing children   5) Right to vote   6) Right to smoke (if you're under 18)   7) Right to drink (18th Amendment)   8) Right to engage in certain activities in public   9) Right to drive as fast as one wants   10) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest river   The list goes on really. The fact is that you don't object to taking rights away in principle, you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain. That is quite inconsistent.   Where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway?
Do you mean like Piltdown Man? It was displayed there for 40 years.   "The Eoanthropus dawsoni, or Piltdown Man, was on display at the Natural History Museum in London for 40 years. It was removed when advanced dating techniques not only showed that the bones were only a few hundred years old, but that some of them weren't even human."   http://www.mentalfloss.com/press_oklahoman2.htm   Do you guarantee that all of the other displays at the Museum are true? No, of course not. Many other things there said to be 'true' are only 'true' in a transient sense of the word (that only science seems to use)   http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_...klywiener.html Suggests that Piltdown Man had good science behind it, at the time.   Never-the-less the Natural History Museum provides many examples of artistic licence, such as the 'human-like' hand given to a restoration of Australopithecus, displayed at the museum.   "Shattering the Myths of Darwinism", p205
Actually, it's not. The big bang theory is also science.   What exactly do you think the big bang theory is? What evidence do you think supports it? What evidence is there against it? why do you disagree? What is your education in cosmology - in other words, why is your disagreement rational?
Yep. Here in the U.S., the 5.7 ammo is the ordinary hollow point for Civilian use. It does not penetrate. It is not Armor Piercing.
That's not evolution. Life has evolved in the lab, many times.
What does a mutation have to do with a heart transplant? What are you smoking?
Because you people keep wanting one restriction after another after another after another. Nothing is ever good enough for you, you always want more than ever. Well we don't want to abide by your wishes, gun ownership is a recognized right, and your hatred of rights won't be tolerated. We're not going to just stand by and be painted as the bad guys because you have the mentally disabled belief that banning gun ownership will reduce crime, and anybody who disagrees with you want to see people killed.
Well, at least accoreding to your "because I say so" belief. The woman, of course, don't need to pay attention to your desire to control her own body in bondage to your particular brand of outraged morality.
Interesting thought..... such a situation would theorectically remove the division of opinion that exists based upon the perspective of gender (ie. the pro-life religious male) and would make any difference of opinion be based on moral/philosophical considerations alone.   You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy. Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest.
So you would go with the unknowable argument?   Well then this is applicable to your response:   So now you have said that god is undefinable or often said "supernatural".   T:I believe in God   A:What is God?   T:I dont know.   Then my question to you would be that if you dont know what God is... then what is it that you believe in?
Because of the rare nature of fossilisation, we don't expect to see perfect transitional lineages through millions and millions of years. I really don't think there are any scientists that think there SHOULD be millions and millions of transitions, because of the nature of fossilisation.   Science is like a detective story. If you wanted to solve a murder, for example, you take a look at the evidence. You have a gun, spent rounds, dead body etc. To convict someone of a murder, you need fingerprints, blood on clothes, DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness.   It's the same for science and the fossil record, because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time. But if you take a look at the fossil record, molecular biology, geological time etc, this is what it shows. From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation, biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth.   3 questions for Calligirl.   For the 4th time. What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form?   When calculating the age of this earth, how precise do you expect or want scientists to get?   How many transitional fossils would you LIKE to see in what period of time?   I really don't think this will progress if you can't tell us what it is you would like to see.
Two things, Symbiote   1) what is the objective basis of rights that makes it different from other value judgements of the majority?   2) when two rights come into conflict, is the result always simple inaction?   3) is the importance of rights greater than democracy? Or is democracy a right? If the latter, how does this work with (2)?   4) how do you react to the fact that in the sorts of cases I mention the results of a rights system is clearly bad for individual people?
I know, Chloe's misuse of the word strikes again.
Certainly, because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally.   To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....   And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony, right, and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by....
False. See above.
logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.   The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law. You can ban abortion is you want...the states did it and the constitution allows it, even if 5 legislatures think otherwise.
You don't consider yourself anymore advanced than animals? Not seperated specially in anyway? If humans are nothing but animals, than you have to question your own views and morals. For if we are just animals, than we have no cause or goals. You may as well kill yourself right now.   Please re-think this idea you have. I understand from your posts that you have a hard emotional problem, and I would urge you to please try and answer yourself those questions. You're views on this issue are built on hate, and annoyance. What morals do you have to support these views other than - You don't like it. -?
Gary Ridgway, the serial murderer of some 60 or more women, possibly more.
Please define "climb upward" and "downhill slide" in biologically meaningful terms. Please define "degeneration."
Actually, I think Kronos is right in this case--at least from the standpoint of most consitutional scholars. Of course the framers didn't envision the wording to be used in this way for this purpose--this is what's simply called a "loophole", in this case anyway. It's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage.
But we have an enumerated Constitutional RKBA. Apples to oranges.
And what does it matter if they're in the army reserve, or a lawyer, a teacher, a doctor?
To say nothing of the possible threats to people's safety, if not actual acts of violence.
While I'm not going to consider Dr. Tiller a pillar of society, I'm certainly not going to condone his murder.
Isn't agreeing with what? The senate hasn't passed any laws that would restrict right to carry anymore than it already is.
If you feed me a lot of caffinated coffee i start to wiggle and squirm too. I'm not really in any pain.
So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?      Your statement "An abortion never has to be done" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?
Really? I suspect that you have been duped by creationist ministers. There is no hype about Miller/Urey. It was an interesting experiment that demonstrated possibilities.
Actually, I don't have any respect for creationism in most of it's varied forms. I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met. But they earned that respect.
You know, this little phrase, "minutes before birth," keeps popping up in reference to abortion.Could someone please explain to me the point of having an abortion "minutes before birth"? What is the point?How many, if any, of this sort of abortion is performed?Could I get a really honest answer to that? Please, no lies.How many?Can anyone tell me?
I don't know if we can be as accurate as a couple of million years, but I agree that the age of the earth is just right for supporting man.
uh, yeah, that was their intent! Under color of law no less. The truth always seems to be your worst enemy doesn't it?
And if God was so against killing the unborn, why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn, why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women?I bet you won't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do. See my signature for examples. 
It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.
Actually, I've heard it all before and it is wrong. The article is full of misinformation and misrepresentation. It is, as you say, slanted rather than an honest report of the data.
No, but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition.
No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious.
Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there.
And Stephen Hawking, the only thing he has said was "I do not believe in a personal god", which would make him a pantheist or deist at best.
Your use of the word "replace" reveals your ignorance of evolution.
One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord.
And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?
Except that the word for day in Genesis 1 is 'yom' and was understood to be a twenty-four hour day.
The human collective is the authority. One major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.
That's the standard dance. Victor Stenger didn't say it that way. On the back of his book, one review puts it this way;
Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers.
No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat. To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers. None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing. But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin.
Actually, this data point is perfectly meaningless.NONE of the other information (or the conclusions) presented in this talk require "26".If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No.A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors.
Very true, especially since when someone asks "is there a God" they are most likely really asking "does the God in which I believe exist"
Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.
See my post above, Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument.
WF, that is true and if the young lady life is endangered then to terminate the pregnancy would be appropriate but get a neutral doctor to make that decision, not one from Planned Parenthood or and abortion clinic who have a biased interest in performing abortions...............That is all I ask...........
I think the energy( essence of the human life) always was
Then why doesn't He answer prayers like He says He will in the Bible?   So is Jesus, aka God, a liar?   Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo's life to be saved really God's child? Gee, I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor, priest, or what have you, that prayed but God didn't listen because that religious leader is a fraud? Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!
Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.
But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.
Because it's a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it.
oh don't kid yourself, you people were miserable long before I got here. Darwinists' arrogance is astounding.
No it doesn't!It cost way more money in appeals than it does to excute someone. WE the taxpayers pay for legal represenatation for them and us, plus the cost of keeping them in jail. The appelas process alone costs the tax payers millions.It is far more expensive to kill them than to leave them in jail with no chance of parole.
Actually, according to your use of the word "person," she is. A significant percentage of fertilized eggs fail to implant and are instead passed. How sad (and typical) that you haven't bothered to educate yourself about these things.
Who is to say that the guys teaching the geology know what they are teaching?
I don't believe Hell is a place either (or even if I believe in hell to begin with), but tell me more about what you mean by this. It sounds interesting.
Exactly. Most people would incorporate it, from childhood most often. Steeeeve can't seem to wrap his mind around that.
There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out.
lets see im going to ask you some questions.are you ?are you a ? do you have blue eyes? do you have brown eyes? now if you say NO to one of those things isnt that cosidered an answer? where i come from its yes or no.2 possible answers. not just yes every time to get what you want.
Right. It was thrown out of schools back in the 1960s, and again in the 1980s when attempts were made to dress creationism up in the jargon of science and call it "Creation science."
Which, we suppose, in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever, right?Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs.Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?
Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. "judicial fiat" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals.
Indeed. And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists aren't allowed to disagree with "standard" theory a laugh. Clearly, evolutionary biologists disagree and those disagreements are published openly. Science makes progress by questioning and disagreement.
SNIPThis opinion piece was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, the same people who opposed all forms of firearms safety training and gun locks, because they might encourage people to feel that they're more capable of safely operation a firearm. The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an "assault weapons ban" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier.
Yes, T. Kennedy is the alias of a known terrorist, and Ted Kennedy got punished because of it. And many are advocating that such a system be used to deny Second Amendment rights and be used to try innocent people in a court of law.
If a square is opposite to a circle (and it isn't, by the way), then gas/liquid/solid must be opposites therefore you contain opposites (by your own argument), in that you contain elements that are in these 'opposite' states. It's an argument I raised before, you said they weren't opposites, now you cite non-opposites! Why do you keep refuting previous arguments they YOU have made?
Yea the legalizatioin of drugs would cause an epedimic of problems. Crime, suicide, mental health problems, and physical health problems.
Well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you? Each woman who has an abortion coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences.
Just so you know Peach, the 167 death row inmates are now serving life in prison. At least that one who's not guilty might now have a chance to be free.
But the number of criminals that have firearms can be reduced. In developed nations that have very strict gun laws there are a lot less criminals obtaining and using guns to commit crimes. How does your theory explain that?
I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it.
'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.   Secondly, the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to 'myth'.   Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood?   PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post.
You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism. Each and every one of those 'indications' are based on misunderstandings and out right lies aboutscience. A discussion about the various methods (and where the YEC claims go wrong can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html
I am hardly a phyicist, but I am under the impression that there is at least some people who feel there is reason that there are 'uncaused causes'. I think thatthe terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not awareof any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris.
What the father wants is ultimately irrelevent.It's the woman's body that carries the fetus. It ultimately the woman's decision. As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion.
No. you're not making any sense. Where is symbiote? I got a horrible argument for him to dispell.
Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim, that can be refuted through logic, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct.This new claim is an interesting one that I have seen others use. I'll tell you on what basis. Based on reason. To hold that nothing can be known for certain, is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense. I'll start a thread about this claim, it's a hot topic to be sure!
Actually, qualified biologists know no such thing. In fact, I've never known one who would agree with that assertion. Can you give us some peer reviewed references to support your assertion?
So parthenegenic births are always female. Where did the X chromosome come from? Is this another case of "POOF, it was a miracle" when faced with reality?
Very well said, but remember, Evolution doesnt mean atheism, but creationism means religion. I know Christians that believe in evolution, but i dont know atheists that believe in creationism.
I fail to see where I broke any of those rules, no names were called, there was no labeling, there was no none of it. And even if there was, you do it all the time, so what makes you any different. Practice what you preach Penfold.
Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.
I see what she was saying now. When she said it it sounded like the man had no opinion at all.
No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system.
And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the "genuineness" of ~2000 year old manuscripts...
The 'teachings' either have no substance, or are certainly not original. Demonstrate categorically just who is the Son of God, and why this figure commands worship and obeisance.
So we don't? I thought we had the capacity to destroy it. That seems within the range of control eh?
Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise. 
I hope I have already begun to change your mind.
So what? If somebody wants to die then they'll kill themselves no matter what.
Right. Please, reread your argument. Not to mention what Woodward actually said about Piltdown man. www.talkorigins.org
This is why the title is "God exists!!! (but he's not who you think he is). It's a funny proof which I don't think Christians would agree this definition was God. But basically it's saying that take the set of all human beings. Call the greatest God. God exists.Not only that, but the final conclusion is one of the premises. The proof is one big circle :)
That sounds like an honest answer. How did you feel about it at the time? How do you feel about it now? Just trying to educate myself more.   Huck
No, neither am I suggesting that illegality makes something immoral. Legality and morality are completely separate things.
Well then it sounds like you don't even know what a SM is seeing as the 3rd one is the main one that people like you bring up when debating this isse.
Abortion is their best choice?????? Yet women deserve better? Why do you think abortion is their best choice?
The same ones you've been told about, what, a few dozen times now? :)A small exerpt:
We share a border with Mexico. The drug cartel is armed with missile and grenade launchers. But when was the last time 72 of our police officers were murdered on American soil, in a single day, at a single location?   The countries with the greatest number of legal gun ownership, they're absent these mass killings that take place on a regular basis. There's no rebels in America killing entire cities worth of people without opposition; not even in the small towns that're without a local police force.   Explain that one away.
Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.
How do you know he was a gun owner? Maybe he borrowed it. ;)And I bet he was a carnivore, walked upright and drove a car, as well.
This isn't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise. Once out of the womb and living on his/her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb. Much like you can drive but this 'right' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything.
True. Gallup couches the questions in a way that favors spiritualism. That is his preference and I think that his polls are slanted that way. I don't think I have ever seen a poll that actually asked the question directly and "no religion" doesn't really ask it. The numbers are just guesses. I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low.
I know this would be somewhat of a drain on your time but I think it would be helpful if you would make a short post at the end of each post stating how much time the next poster has, what post number this is, how many are left, any comments concerning going outside the rules, etc.
Why are you dishonest enough to claim that you aren't trying to get YEC into the schools.
deliberate acts of fabrication to produce false and fradulent claims as to what others have said. You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought. In fact, some of the cited refute such claims.
There is some truth here. Did you ever see "Independence Day"? They were taking pot-shots at the alien ships when they first arrived. It didn't stop the aliens... sure only a film... let's look at real life...modern - Iraq - Sadaam gave guns out to the people just before Gulf War IInot so modern - Boer War - Dutch farmers in South Africa were all excellent marksmen - Britain still invaded.US Civil War - I believe that the Confederate States were pretty well armed as far as the white citizens were concerned. US still invaded.
She could, but not all do :) Despite the fact that it works, there are still unwanted pregnancies :) That doesn't change the fact that a pregnancy would not be pleasant to a woman who does not want to be pregnant :)Forcing pregnancy by law is a step toward fascism.
Because of the history of it. Well, ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass 'seperation of church and state'. Let's just say that I.D. is an attempt to teach Creationism in school.
And if the "natural process of evolution" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked?
I think you might want to check your logic here... As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit. As you are, I am not terribly fond of policing someone's personal habits, but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries, assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored. This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem.
And how would Bush look if his own people hated him so much that they revolted? That would be very bad publicity, and quite an embarrassment that I wouldn't want as a country leader.
The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)
So,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?Sure,if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion,no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume "armed citizens" would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not.
Really? I don't think you know what you are talking about. Please provide evidence to back your claim. Thanks.
So was I. I did say I was playing devil's advocate. As far as I'm concerned, Tiktaalik is a triumph of scientific deduction.
No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as "proof" of a young earth.
As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think.
Here's a question; which one split from the other? Which one is the "new" being? None of them are. If I get a cake and slice into two exact pieces, which one is the "new" slice? They are both equally new.
That seems unlikely. He gets banned everywhere he goes with his multiple names. He's not very good at hiding his identity and not very good at controlling his temper when dealing with the sort of creation believing XXXXXX that you get frequenting these boards (I can't say I blame him on the latter point).Look around the web though and you will find him elsewhere...
As an aside I do admire your way with words, bravo!
Yes that is a problem. But there is an instance when the 2nd Amendment did protect the USA from invaders:"Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland US forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast" - http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob70.htmlIf it wasn't for the 2nd Amendment you would be speaking Japanese if you live on the West coast, German if you live on the East coast.
Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals.
Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing.
And yet there are plenty of websites written by scientists with the details:
What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.
maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points.
Throw off our conclusions about what? I'm getting a bit confused as to what you're trying to cast doubt upon.Dark matter is stuff that doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, so again by definition anything that we can't 'see' using EM waves is dark matter. this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly
I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, "And the truth shall set you free"!!! 
It's not just cars and catalytic converters have greatly decreased emissions.
So, IOW, you are saying that those of us who are intelligent enough to realize that your non existent imaginary god doesn't exist have a chemical imbalance? Wow, that's quite a stretch even for you Archie baby.
Ill be the first to agree with the saying "If you can...and have the place to...you will" But like anything else..you have to look at the better side of things...It would act like a deterant to allow our responsable citizens to be armed..yes perhaps what you said might take place..but the benefits would outway them..and thats all we can ask for in life.As for our irresponsable citizens...they are already armed.
Your wrong. Airplanes and courthouses are gun free zones but these places never have massacres.
Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person.
This is a separate issue, Voice of Reason. Some didn't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally wouldn't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other's right to do it, and that's what I was answering.
Tell this to those infants and adults in the netherlands who are being euthanized against their will. this is a logical conclusion of a quality of life ethic without a sanctity of life basis.
I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood
Kent Hovind is a slimy, uneducated, hack. His only education past high school is a degree from an unaccredited bible school. He is also a liar, since I just can't believe that anyone could be so stupid to say some of the things that he does. Of course, there are other people that are so stupid that they actually believe him.
And if you rewind a little over 40 years, the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage.Archie's reply is a non-argument, and false at that.Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage, but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage.Little things like child rape, lack of consent, and other issues.
It's quite obvious that it's the ID proponents who have issues with definitions, particularly among themselves. Behe has changed his own definition of IC, and Dembski changed Behe's definition of IC.
I'm not surprised.   That's a typical response when someone calls your bluff.   Waxy
Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent.
But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent.
Nobody should be forced to even have a sonagram. I think that you'll find reasonable pro-life and pro-abortion people believe that much.
What basis do fundamental rights derive from? In other words, how can we tell whether something is a fundamental human right?
Now you're playing word games to confuse people. Page 11 of the Heller ruling stated that the definition of "arms" include all modern forms of bearable arms that're in common use. They didn't rule on machineguns because they weren't part of the case.
Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of "creation science" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion.
**True, and the confusion was my bad, as explained already. However, the fact of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, as demonstrated by Ames and by Cairns, still shoots great big holes in the darwinist assumptions arising out of your old war-horses, Luria & Delbruck '43, and its "clone", Lederberg and Lederberg '52.
I believe you have even debated that it is conditioned into humans to be religious and therefore it validates religions. So why is there a need to debate whether animals love if they are acting on a conditioned response?
And yet you can offer nothing to show it's impossible! It most certainly is a plausible explaination! Fairytale?!? Don't think so, a logical path for the developement of the avian lung.
I see, when you say "I'm not an expert" do you mean you aren't a climate scientist or do you mean you don't have the scientific knowledge to discuss this?
That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects. The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling. Then the evolutionists would say that happenstance origins caused gravity to work that way, and ID proponents would say that a supernatural design caused gravity to work that way. Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your "apple falling" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple. 
And you've been failing miserably, partly because your definition of "atheism" is asinine. Even most Christians would disagree with you.
The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.
Really? Why? Bacteria don't need to see to exist. They don't depend on light to live. In fact, bacteria thrive in dark, moist areas. Why would natural selection determine this ability as being advantageous? If populations of bacteria with the ability to sense light are "better suited" than other bacteria, how many different types of light-sensing bacteria are there? 
I know it's almost as silly as thinking gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage.
my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.
Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion. In typical fashion you make claims which you don't support at all. Here is my post below, point out WITH EVIDENCE!!! what I am distorting in any way; especially that which I hold dear. In other words, write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack. emoticonXDonno
Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!
Actually, there is no such thing as "an evolutionary mutation of a gene." A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?
But if the repeated tests just confirm the same errors or misinterpretations of the results, all of the independent reviews in the World wont make a difference.
Actually, I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only, but after reading the CBO report, I see that I wasn't far off. They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed.
So every woman who has an abortion lives an irresponsible life. Care to give any examples, or are you just spouting rubbish with no experience or knowledge whatsoever?
So you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone. Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller. You brought up KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy) and you weren't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1" tall? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans?
You could've just as easily revived the last thread, commenting on how the antis are unusually silent.
Because Apes, monkeys and chimps are on different paths. You wouldn't expect a shark to evolve into a barracuda-like animal. things evolve to fill niches, we currently fill a niche, there is nothing pushing apes, chimps or other primates to fill a niche that is occupied. 
But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on. 
Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.
Well, since you have natural selection completely wrong, it must not go too well with the Biblical account. By the way, now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context. What is a "kind." Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a "kind." Please show why a "kind" only has the ability to lose information.
And that is different how? I told johnny to write that I'm infallible. Therefore the book that I told johnny to write proves I'm infallible. There is no difference.   You do realize that there are other religions out there? That science is constantly updating?   Your arguments have been nothing more then false dichotomies assuming there are only two choices despite history laughing in your face.
It's the first couple of paragraghs from the article in this weeks NS. If you had an online subscription or got a copy from your newsagent you could read the whole thing, unfortunately with this one the intro rambles on a bit and doesn't get to the point till the second column...
See above. Whether a couple is or isn't monogomous is not for you to determine or worry about. And speak for yourself if you don't mind. This member of the American public's mental health is just fine thank you very much. If gay marriage impacts YOU that much, well that sounds like your problem.
Nice raising the bar. Fallacies are a creationist's best friend. You claimed:"have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure."Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes (which are proteins) don't count.
No! At conception we are a person and human.All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.
True, they can change laws if the are unconstitutional. So what makes a ban on abortion unconstitutional?   Also, what makes the dealth penalty for minors constitutional one day and not the next? In fact 15yrs ago it wasn't an unconstitutional decision. I guess now it is??? Makes no sense.   Clive14,   those are obviously not my beliefs as I think everyone is equal.   I am not sure your wealth makes you different from someone else. It means you wealth is unequal..we are talking about just people. We all end up 6 foot under (so to speak) in the end.
I think this is a bad way to put it...the evidence that they earth has been warming since we have had the ability to measure temperature is overwhelming...the cause is unknown and whether or not it is natural is unknown. It does seem fairly narasistic to think in 100 years we have caused so much damage to an earth that at least has been here 10,000 years.
Possibly, depends on what you read and by whom. Still, the war wasn't aganist slavery.
Heart bypass, prostate cancer.......I have a couple of Canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to Bellingham Wash and had the Surgery within 2 weeks............
I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.
I see your point, Iangb but I'm not about to be leaving before you've had a chance to respond. I won't be "leaving" at all. You challenged me to produce an argument, so I'm going to produce my argument. I will then summarize the argument, and you can respond to it and we can then discuss / debate those specifics that you have a problem with.Truthfully, this is how I should have first responded to your challenge. Doing it piece meal has only resulted in a less focused debate.--Chuz
Yes, it is, and I'll gladly excuse his grammar compared to my zero ability in Hungarian.
Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?
people keep saying thats the law in texas,so Im saying that this is the law in New York,He broke the law so he had it coming,next time dont disrespect the law and get a license,Im just showing how some of the people on this board are major hypocrites,you suddenly get all soft on crime when you dont like the law,
But the responsibility does not end with the woman who experiences the pregnancy. If it did, then men would not be required by law to pay child support.
You lie. You keep saying the same things over and over again, that doesn't make them true. Your addiction to violence is showing.Tony Martin shot an unarmed 16 year old kid in the back as he was running away. That's not self-defence, that's cold blooded murder.It is not the role of individuals to exact revenge for crimes committed against them. You don't get to take the law into your own hands. Munir Hussain ran after the intruders and beat them up with a cricket bat in the street. That's not self-defence, that's revenge.
I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?
True, but I was referring to psychological explanations, not genuine reasons.
I don't see how this is not a debate about abortion. True, it's become mildly less concrete, but that's what happens when you try to get it right.
actually they probably drifted much faster than that.....probably upon a pole reversal.
Well, it seems to me that if you have a reflex it means you have an at least partially developed and functional nervous system which would tell me that you can feel pain.
If you truly believe this then I think you need to re-read your posts and put yourself in the shoes of those on the receiving end. 
So, this statement is from a 'law center' that is dedicated to defend the religious freedom for CHristians. Yet, this isn't about 'religion'. Why do I find that hypocritical.
You don't even take into consideration the possibility that Japan could have a higher mass murder rate- perhaps the same as the US- if guns were freely available in that country. You have a lot of explaining to do if you expect me to buy what you're trying to peddle. 
Really? The transcript shows that he did not ask her anything in the Gay marriage section of the discussion.Transcript can be found here: http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/pr...al-debate.htmland here: http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/...ipt/index.html (click on the same-sex benefits section and the transcript shows up right next to the video)
well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.
I think you're mixing up socialist and fascist. Patriotism is anathema to socialism.
Yes, to follow his commandments to love God and to love one another.
There is a pretty huge difference.Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences.
Pretty good considering Darwin wasn't aware of genetics. Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859. The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms.
HA wouldnt you say someone who is really overweight actually has more of a problem with stress on their joints, muscels, heart, and bladder than a woman carrying a small child in her womb? Obesity can demand major scarifices in behavior and diet. Some of which can be detrimental.I really dont see your point because this isnt just a woman's problem when it comes to these issues you pointed out.And im not really sure what a "pregnancy" is according to you.. please explain.. When i hear the word pregnant, i think of 2 people, not just 1.Also, the baby has its own blood, its own immune system, and contains its own calories once consumed. theres nothing that the mother has that the baby doesnt other than it just needs nutrtion. Just like you need food everyday.
Cases v United States, 131 F. 2d 916 (1st Cir. 1942), cert. Denied sub nom., Velazquez v. U.S, 319 U.S. 770 (1943). Basically, The US Curcuit Court upheld that the Second Amendment didn't apply to weapons that couldn't be carried by an individual.
Butwhat of the fetus/babies that were wanted by daddy but not by mummy what does termination stop then?
Well I'm glad its no problem for your son. No child deserves to be harrassed.
This is more of a legal question involving whether or not it was negligence(sp). If so, you can't really sue for amounts of money you MIGHT get in the future. He could sue for lost pay on the job and other medicial procedures. So ya know :). I don't really know what the question is.
So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?
Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.
Actually you are incorrect. The most commonly used rifles on the competition circuit are so-called "assault weapons".The "assault weapon" moniker is a term just recently fashioned to describe a military looking weapon.There are several target competitions designed solely for these types of rifles.
Yes, the Byzantines are a Catholic Rite. The Catholic Church is divided into rites- there are seven I believe, the Roman, of course, being the largest. The Byzantine Catholics are an Eastern Catholic Rite, and as you said are almost identicle to the Orthodox Churches except that they acknowledge the Pope as the head of the Church.East to West, a website regarding all the churches of the Catholic Church, especially those of the east.Real quick, the Orthodox acknowledge the Pope as the successor of Peter, but not as the head of the Church. Am I correct?
I would be interested to see where I made such a claim. Prove your assertion.
You do realize that the rules are supposed to be absurd, to point up the absurdity of a recent court ruling, right?
That is what supersport is hoping to do... However, assuming that you are correct in your interpretation, he has no chance of doing it so well.
I believe it is merely all known living species against those known by the fossil record and extinct. There are undoubtedly more extinct species that we are unaware of than living ones.
It is not only supposedly "junk DNA" that was used for these kind of arguments. The vertebrate eye has been preached to be a bad design. Why? Why is it a bad design?      The human eye contain bona fide optical fibers to conduct light (nice illustration). B
From my first post, starting with the quote from the religioustolerance website;
And folks that refuse to see the legitimate ones put us all at risk. Touche.
Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, "the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God," and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God? 
"He" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality. For some of us it's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day. But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists, it does nothing to lessen His reality.
No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.
so we would penalize financially those who want to have kids?
If your friend is hearing voices in her head to walk into traffic, she needs some psychiatric help.
Being in the minority or in the majority is irrelevant. Belief has no bearing on reality.
Yes, it is very hard, even for theologians, to explain.
Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood. And it goes way the heck beyond speculation. Check out how homeobox genes work and how regulation by master switches is understood as just two examples.
Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes.
I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.
Its amazing how the facts are in front of thier faces yet they still claim they are only for "Reasonable" gin control laws.
I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.
Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results.
There are in place control procedures for traveling with weapons. All he should be charged with, and I expect he will before this is tried in court is breaking the Airport procedures, or maybe they are FAA procedures which could imply Federal laws.   This guy should have contacted the Airport at check in to report each and every weapon he was traveling with. They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed. I must say that I'm somewhat alarmed at some of what is allowed if I put my terrorist thinking cap on. FAA News
You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be. This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs.
I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though.
Nothing.... they both have to live with the shame of killing their baby.
No, Creationism is the specific idea that the creation story in Genesis is literally true (creation ex nihilo, direct creation of organisms, global flood, etc). It is false.
...and 8 beers are imo worse than one joint. People tend not to smoke as many 'doses' of pot as they drink 'doses' of alcohol.
And my interpretation of my writing is that I didn't mean that. Who has more authority?
It is worse then that they just don't get it. Once you put some civil rights on the ballot nothing is off limits. Freedom of speech, religion, assembly ect.. they are all up to be voted out of existence for an unpopular minority by the majority. They just don't get it.
I'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion. Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young. Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful.
Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?Genesis says that all creatures were specially created. It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.Statis is the norm not the exception.One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?
Pregnancy is a health issue only for the woman. Your glib remark pretending to sympathy is insulting.
IF! But here's the thing, Mexico is making absolutely no attempt to truly stomp out the drug cartels, they're catering to them! Various political figures and police officers are on the take, they're getting massive amounts of bribe money from the cartels, stopping them would prove detrimental.
Accidents happen, that's just how life works. They're tragic, and they're upsetting, but there's no way to avoid them.
But I'll bet that you don't know what any of them are. 
Just out of curiosity, what do you feel you could sue the company for? Descrimination? Could I sue Wal Mart or Dillons for not carrying a line of adult movies and sex toys? After all, I have a right to own adult movies and sex toys. Doesn't that mean that Wal Mart automatically has the responsibillity to provide those goods? After all, they are the biggest retailer in my area.
So producing a child is the defining characteristic of a marriage? What about love, trust, respect, companionship? My wife and I may decide to not have a child, does that mean our marriage should be made illegal? Again, you keep posting nambla this and nambla that. Nambla is a group of deviant pedophiles, homosexuals despise this behavior too. GROW UP DHARD...I mean DMG2FUN. ;)
It's worse than that, Pandion. For example, here's what I told him over at ARN on the same subject back on April 5th. http://www.arn.org/ubbthreads/showfl...e#Post30331420
Criminals continually inform the public that their greatest fear is a victim capable of fighting back against them and possibly killing them.
Humans are about the furthest thing from perfect. The bible IS perfect, it's flawless. You can't take anything from it and prove it to be incorrect. The only thing that even comes close is misinterpretations of certain sentences. I know plenty of people who don't believe in any sort of God and aren't bothered by the thought that this is all they have, the only life they'll ever live. Maybe some people need to believe in more to live more, but all people don't.
Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?
And religion is what caused the Crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. Many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called "in the name of atheism".
Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under "evolution" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose "science" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea.
Life evolved over billions of years rather than being created in a few days.
People have entertained and will always continue to entertain beliefs in all manner of propositions. Many people once believed that the earth is flat:perhaps some still do. But this has nothing to do with scientific truth.There is no "version" of science that one chooses from a menu of possibilities.By definition, scientific enquiry arrives at hypotheses after gathering evidence from observations and experiment. Any law, knowledge, etc. thatis arrived at by scientific method is open to modification or falsification if new evidence comes to light that must be taken into account. All science in this sense is provisional.The apostles may have believed that Jesus walked on water: that does NOTmake it true.
It's thanks to the opposers of the theory that all this rubbish about descending from monkeys and slimeball came about, all ppl need is a bit more education and things should become clearer.
And what if it is one to me? Then your refute is equally refuted. The support for us not knowing lies in you and other's inability to provide anything beyond speculation as support for the assertion that an unborn child is not a person. Your own inability is my support.
They can if they're Catholics since Evolution is accepted doctrine now in the Church.
Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.
I see I jumped the gun. That was well stated.
Chloe, the point of this thread is to help you understand what the argument is, not to give analogies to abortion.
And what would make them separate species? How about wolves and dogs, separate species? How about Great Danes and Chihuahuas? They cannot interbreed under any circumstances (even artificially - the fetus isn't viable).
Please provide the actual estimates of the time required along with the necessary references if you please! How much time WOULD it take with confidence limits please!
Actually both are relative in every situation. Especially "The Truth" as espoused by religious fundamentalists such as yourself, as there are as many different versions of the truth as there religious fundamentalists.
The majority of criminals don't want to deal with trouble. Most aren't looking for a shootout where there's a risk of them getting shot at and most don't even want to shoot period. Most are just looking for the free stuff they can get or in cases of rape they're definately not looking to fight an armed victim. It has been shown that criminals are less likely to break into a house whose owner has a gun.
Well, I did say I was being nit-picky: all I was objecting to was the way the original wording suggested that the change was occurring in order to avoid competition. Assuming it was due to selection, the competition from the larger birds was the putative agent of that selection.(Incidentally, I suspect we live on the same side of the Atlantic.)
And the loss to society because people used guns instead of an alternate weapon is?
The US is still the closest thing to a pure capitalist country in the world. But you are correct, our system is not a pure capitalist one. We have reminants of all types of systems including socialism. In the modern world I don't think a society as large as the US is could be run under just one pure system.
Just to contribute, I'm pro-gun, have had training in the proper use and laws in my area, and have owned weapons for more than 30 years.
the reason why premise 1 can logically stand is that God is first of all defined as the "greatest possible being". no matter what reality we are considering, such a thing as the greatest possible being in that relity must exist. "greatest" is a superlative, compared to all other beings that existits like "the oldest man alive". no matter what scenario, such a person as the oldest man alive will always exist, therefore such a man (that fits that definition) will have a necessary existence
Would you mind telling us just how he determined ALL maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements? To me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so! After all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence! Your claim would seem to be impossible, but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so.
here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.
So? The point was that people who support gun control are not necessarily communists.
I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.
Very well said. However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected. That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights. However, safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense.
Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.
This makes more sense then anything else I've heard on this thread.
Your stats aren't broken down into meaningful groups, so nothing is learned WRT Muslims.
If same sex couples are offered equal rights under a PACS (or some other legally recognized union) as married couples, why does it matter which "door" they come in through? They get all the same benefits, including the benefits that come when one partner dies.What's the beef...except that you can't say that you're "married"?
There is never a question of "killing people" in such circumstances, it a matter of deciding if treatment should be withdrawn and thus allow them to die, i.e. where there is no possibility of any sort of a recovery.
I do not empathise with an embryo or early fetus the way I imagine I would with my late-term fetus or born child.I fully intend to have children in the future, including through adoption possibly. When I do I will love them with all my heart and put their needs above my own. I'm not going to do a half-assed job of parenting; I'll give it 100%.But not yet.Prototype:
logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law. You can ban abortion is you want...the states did it and the constitution allows it, even if 5 legislatures think otherwise.
See above. A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence. Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked, rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in.
Well, there is a little more to it than that, but agreed.
Well said. It is a disgrace that the "Flat Earth" side of the argument never gets a look in geography lessons and that the "Spontaneous Creation" side of the argument never gets a look in when teaching kids about the life cycle of insects. Do you realise that they refuse to present the "Cheese" side of the argument when teaching about the moon these days? It's outrageous, how can our kids get a balanced education if such bias is allowed to continue!
Well excuuuuse me if I screwed that up in this post. Have a nice day. :)
But not just any seven judges, seven judges who's job is to define the constitution.
YES, of course, they could not actually hunt, since that would be illegal, possibly a felony, whihc could lead to forfeiture of your rights.
So what? It's not like institutions in this country haven't been changed before, including the supposed intitution of marriage! Guess what? It's called progress, get used to it. 
Actually, I meant the behaviour refered to in her post was interesting.
I think the FSM threw these guys a bone. They cherrypicked which taxa would give them the most statistically significant results. If they were to expand the method to include more and more taxa, they'd see the Noodly Appendage of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Ramen.
And the point was, Benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. If you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. If it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. If it is a web page, then the URL should be given.Even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. Generally AIG is really bad science and isn't very interesting. It is misleading, intentionally. However, on these boards are familiar with their stuff.
"True" is not a good use of language to describe opinion. With regard to his opinion, I think he makes some good points, so I don't really need to ask him if its true. You on the other hand do need to speak to Olsen as you are claiming his letter rubbishes the concept of evolution- an opinion I hazard he would very much disagree with.
Not only do their superiors in higher courts think they are a joke, but their peers in other circuit courts think they are a joke.
How is that a strawman? Your challenge directly relies upon something you assume to be proven, but has not been. Therefore even in a hypothetical stance, your underlying arguments are invalid, thus leading to everything else being invalid. You're not doing so well on this forum.
And what is an inheritance? Proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life. 15 Good understanding giveth favor 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid. What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure. 
Except in the Dred Scott case the court wasn't trying to determine whether slavery was a collective or individual right, or what the constitution applied to in regard to slavery.
Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfmIt is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something.
But people start threads here all the time against Christianity regardless of whether someone claims something here about it or not. It's prejudice, pure and simple, and you're no exception. Now, one would think, being the supposedly non-Christian enlightened person you are, you would simply say "oh, I didn't realize that my posts came across as anti-Christian sometimes, and that it indicates a prejudice on my part, and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking." I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking.
Still clueless and still presenting a barrel of laffs I see. Have someone that can read and comprehend spell it out for you. I bet yer mun is considering that to get you out of the basement. How's the weight loss coming by the way?
And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
You've asked a good question cash, the way you know that is by all of the excuses you're getting rather than any attempts to actually answer you directly with solid evidence. Of course we know that evidence doesn't exist, but they'll never admit that either. emoticonXGood
It seems to be the reason for crafting this new, individual right against the States. Since the original purpose of the Second Amendment doesn't appear to be needed, there is a new use that is protected.
Bad comparisons. A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes (not just limiting it to gun homicides).
This is poor example. Focusing on saving lives over burying the dead doesn't do anything to trump personal autonomy.
I dunno... we already have enough fundies thinking that the Big Bang is part of evolution...
Do you believe that the freedom to not participate in any religion whatsoever is not covered by the expression "Freedom of Religion"?
Things like future proof of a young earth - evolution needs billons of years. Or proof of severe weather conditions that would destroy the evolutionary process. Life on earth dies completely if it gets out of a fairly narrow temperature range, any time during those billions of years.
"Usually, "rationality" is a Humpty-Dumpty word, that means whatever the user finds is convenient to club his opponents with."http://world.std.com/~mhuben/skept/rationality.htmlKnowledge itself is a limited commodity. To make a claim that everything is knowable is a statement that is impossible to prove; Scientism makes this claim. Closely related to it is Objectivism."Scientism, in the strong sense, is the self-annihilating view that only scientific claims are meaningful, which is not a scientific claim and hence, if true, not meaningful."http://skepdic.com/scientism.htmlRecommended Reading:"Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time" by Michael ShermerNot only does it include creationism, :) but also the philosophy of Ayn Rand (Objectivism)
Lots of makers are still churning out lever action rifles. I am sad to see Winchester closed, but sad feelings is not a good financial reason to keep a poorly run company open.
Actually, it isn't. It is complex and complicated. It requires diligent study of difficult concepts. But when you grasp the basics, it does become evident. But most creationists aren't willing to put in the effort.
It doesn't make sense because no one makes that claim. There are some random events that take place that may have an effect on evolution. That does not mean that evolution is random.
Because the judges President Bush nominates are strict constructionist.They interpret the law not make it...........That is the worse nightmare for a liberal or a gay who depend on judges to over rule the vote of the people............They can't win at the ballot box so they think they can win in the courts....It won't happen.get use to it................
Who said it did? I was only pointing out the absurdity of gun control laws and how they lead to federal overlords deeming that your not capable of playing with matches. (I would not be suprised if this were next.)
You can forget the loaded language including false notions of progress. Lifeforms are evolving by way of purely physical and chemical mechanisms.
He is a hell of a lot wiser than thee.
Yes. Oddly, the picture makes as much sense as most creationists. :)
So what? I don't care! Gun ownership is an individual right and that's the end of it! You don't have to exercise a right hundreds of thousands of times a year for it to be protected by the Constitution.
Well, ya know, if you actually, oh I don't know, VISITED THE SITE, you'd see that the "friendlyatheist.com" is a blog-like page (and not the one that is actually giving the info on the evolutionary migration of humanity) and it gave a link to the actual website that we are talking about (the second link I gave): http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/But then, maybe we're expecting a little too much from a creationist. emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead
Evolution doesn't explain the event. The event is an example of evolution - a change in the frequency of alleles in a populatioin over time. The explanation may or may not be evolution by natural selection. You merely asserted that based on your imagined case.
All born children, and every woman had the right to be rid of them. Killing them is not required as abortion is when they are in the womb (during the timeframe the majority of abortions occur, at least). They are not comparable.
Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By "true human" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent. I have got to go to school, continue this later.
So you still choose to believe that someone who's a victim of crime should be punished as if they committed the crime themselves?
Actually, this (if what that article is true, which I am not quite sure) is a healthy part of science. Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare. Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed. Man's theories change everyday, while God's word has remained the same.
But it is based on history. There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions. Or, if their families had money. went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries.Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services.
Since evolution is a non-theistic theory (it does not consider if there is a god or not), you will have to look at some like http://www.theistic-evolution.com/I would also look up Kenneth MIller on the web... a highly Christian biologist who defends evolution.
?? What are you trying to say?Science is knowledge, all knowledge, that is, anything we find to be true. There is no other "truth" out there, if there were, we'd be omniscient.
Pregnancy is always harmful to the woman's body. However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two.
**Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism.
This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.
And they could have experienced more without gun control. You're jumping to conclusions.
Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.
The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. Personally, I disagree. When we kill children in Iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all.
Yeah, see this is the old "gateway drug" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a "gateway" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something "harder"? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.
So much for your cover. Its blown. You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons. Or else your statement is evil and was forced upon you by the devil. Maybe you will never know - in this life at least :(
Yes, the horror of voluntarily taking orders from someone in exchange for monetary rewards!!   If you hate your job that much, quit. You aren't being oppressed because someone offered you the option to do something. If you don't like it, don't do it. If you hate trade, you can go wander through the wilderness and eat berries and roots.
You said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. How is that a misinterpretation?   You're asking for proof of a negative. How many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? We don't know...   Erm.... You're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly. I'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class.
Actually, it has.      The last time I checked, well still have gay marriages in Massachusetts. As a matter of fact, it seems that it is difficult for most politicians to be elcted in the state without being supportive of marriage equality.
Actually Electro, do you remember this thread?   Evidence for a flood? Oddly enough it took 20 pages before one of them even tried to argue against the reasons why the flood did not occur.
You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.
Just because they're our representatives, doesn't give them permission to trample the Constitution and the protections provided to the citizens. Look at how many laws have been passed, only to be invalidated and ruled as unconstitutional.
You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.I have to say that is false. We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. In addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up. So sorry, but you struck out.
What about the pain and death inflicted upon the innocent women and girls forced to give birth? Have you no regard for them?
Whether a fetus is a person is not something open to consideration. An apple is not an orange. The reason that we have two words to apply as labels is simply because they absolutely are not the same thing. It is that simple.Suppose that a fetus is frozen and implanted in a female 22 years later. Is it of legal drinking age at birth? Obviously not. We currently have the technology to actually do this.
You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.
A being is something that is conceivable as existing...or something that actually exists.A human being is one of us, a homo-sapien, a member of the group of beings known as animals.A rock is a being of inanimate qualities.God is the supreme being, not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him (or It, or She) on the same level as those that He created.We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!God is great.God is good.Let us thank Him for our food.God is my shepherd.God is my Light.God is my Co-pilot.God is what keeps me from believing that all this (the totality of all things and happenings) came about by accident.When God made man, She was only kidding! ;)
But we also don't know that evolution is true - it is a belief system about the past that requires faith for it to have any reason. Your first part is already false (proved above).
Iangb, I would have thought that you would be intellectually honest enough to have (at least) accepted the fact that I have supported my claims. I also thought that (by now) someone from your side of the abortion issue would step in (in this thread or by private message) and hold you to your claims of being 'intellectually honest.' At this point, I actually have you questioning Planned Parenthood's definitions? QUOTE; 
Well, the question I am asking is for you to provide a valid scientific prediction based on creationism.
Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology. 
At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to XXXX you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?
Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone "up there" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify.
So for example if I say "you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are "a part" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside.
23,000 firearms were handed in when the UK had its gun ban. According to your logic those people that handed in their firearms can still be prosecuted because they took possession of a firearm prior to the ban. I don't think so.
But bestiality consists of animal cruelty, so very much hurts another. Just not another human.
I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!
The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference. Also new fossils suggest a trees down development of bird flight so fully developed flight muscles and feathers were not necessary.
So country by country, the world is going to hell in a hand basket. And this pleases you, why? emoticonXFrazzled
Hello, please read http://www.reasons.org/resources/apo...ing.shtml?mainIt is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with Dr Russell Humphreys' hypothesis.The universe and Earth are very old. We know this as a fact. Why would God lie to us? If the Universe looks old, then it is. To claim otherwise is to call God a liar.
Well, that's generally true of any process that uses energy. Some is wasted.
I don't think that any marriage rights are required at all by the Consitution.
And I just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. Get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. Let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. Otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.Mo
But growth is fairly irrelevant. My sperm can grow into a human too, and have mental existence, yet ejaculating isn't murder. It just becomes a huge debate on where to draw the line, therefore it is best to focus on the state that it is right NOW. Not what it was or could possibly be.That seems reasonable to me.[/QUOTE]
You know what is far worse than murder itself? Executing people to save some money.
Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said "minimal or negligable physical damage".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the "peg" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.
I see the difference, but that's not what Obama is trying to do. He got us to buy the pig at a firesale and is hoping to make money selling it back to the original farmer or give it to the fieldhands.
When the President is in public, there are plenty of people around him ...with guns.
I have no idea what this could possibly mean. It makes no sense, semantically or logically. It is so vague as a concept as to be worthless in terms of the pursuit of knowledge.
Intelligent design comes in many flavors too.ID that submits as a designer something that has any quality of the unknowable is irrational.ID that submits we were created/designed by things inside the universe that are knowable are rational claims. However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?
Just curious, is it beyond you to make a post that includes common sense and logic? I'm thinking it is since all of you posts seem to be based on rhetoric and emotion. Three paragraphs and all of them contain a falsehood/ lie, congrats your batting 1.000.
So who's the head honcho?   It's not like all these professional scientists all see eye to eye. There are even scientists that hold to theistic evolution.
I believe a man should be able to opt out of fatherhood.The problem with this article for me is the moral ambiguity - there is no consistent argument laid out for free choice, that is choice for women and men, or even one for consistent slavery (forced births from women, forced money from men). It reeks of the vindictiveness that can be seen in any number of fringe movements, of the "I don't really care whether we live in a just society, as long as you're not treated better than me".So yes, I "a real pro-choicer" agree with Matt here, the pro-choicers who are portrayed as disagreeing appear to be some kind of stereotyped 1970s feminist-socialist-activist-bra-burning type.
If there is a positive relationship between drug consumption and crime, it doesn`t seem very likely that crime would go down as a result of lowering the price on drugs (and thus rasing consumption).
Actually it would be impossible for the monblock to spin. There is NO PLACE OUTSIDE OF IT from which to observe! Any observer would necessarily be inside the budding universe - no place else to go you see. Indeed its still impossible for us to know whether the universe as a whole is spinning or not!!!! Sorry I was being a bit ironic thinking you would see the point. Guess not though.
And that's the rub: it never has (apart from when it has of course, with the various versions that exist). You choose to put faith in the writings of a primitive bronze age society. I prefer to trust a textbook that is regularly updated to reflect our latest findings; our most up to date and accurate knowledge of the world.
Chuz, the purpose of this summary is not to summarise your arguments as a whole - it is to summarise what your argument is up to this point.   Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.
Jake good try at manipulating scriptures. Jesus is all about family values. The point of thsoe scriptures is that His gospel is above everything else. The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.
This has everything to do with guns,how are these people suppose to protect   themselves?Since the police have been told to just let them go, crime will run   rampant, it will become THE place to go if you feel like duing a little robbery a little burglary,gosh wonder if they gotta let rapo's and killers runaway to.   Only 2000? I lived in George Wa. and the population was less than 2000,it was also just off I-90 and we had plenty of crime from people passing through not   necessarily from people who lived there.
Really? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird.
it has been known for a long time -- it's just been surpressed because it contradicts genetic determinism and neo-darwinsm in general.
That distinction may be irrelevant since they do say that no god that any religious person believes in exists. And that is what I was getting at originaly. Still I think that the idea that the existence of all religious gods can be ultimately refuted based on the logic you bring up is invalid.
I think the OP said it pretty well. If an organism or cell can process information and then make decisions based on that information, that's intelligence.
Depends on the usage. Generally, it just refers to the Theory of Evolution or a change in allele frequencies in a population.
So please tell me who would be the actual criminals if the Government violated the Supreme Law of the Land and made all guns illegal?But I do thank you for proving that there are people out there who want them all, despite The Bill of Rights says and what the Supreme Court proved was the correct meaning!
Oh I can easily spend $1,000 dollars an hour. If I could I would also have plenty of reason to live to be 114.
If this is what passes for American healthcare, then your need for change is even more desperate. None of these "treatments" is available on the NHS.
Sure they matter. But that isn't the issue here. You posted this in the abortion forums as if this medical malpractice which is taking place in an impoverished third world country is justification for it in America. That is a ludicrous and totally bogus argument to make.If you thought rationally, you would have it in the health forum and be complaining about how third world countries are so ill prepared for this common problem when we have the technology so readily available to avoid it. My Lord simone, a simple C-Section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby. But you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution. It makes no sense at all, and yet you post it thinking that you're contributing something rational. Go figure, huh!!! emoticonXFrazzled
Oh, I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I'm completely for it.
Well to get healthcare from $6000 per person to $3,400 per person you'd have to pay them less or fire them. So do I understand you correctly that we will either cut pay or fire doctors and nurses?EDIT: that seems dramatic...not "fire" them but they will basically go into another profession since they are no longer needed.
But doesn't Genesis imply that creation occured in one 7-day period (though the days could be symbollic)?
This question is premised on an untenable assumption: that people should not be allowed to vote on particular issues. This premise is clearly not true in any democratic society, and is especially not true in the United States. In the United States, it is a contradiction in terms to say someone is not allowed to vote on X. I have demonstrated this before, and yet the same silly question keeps coming up.
I think that's a good question. I also wonder how long the medical establishment has had this rule? Since there must be some long-standing procedures in executions in the United States that require, by law, a doctor's supervision.
Though I know you directed this question at Cthulhu, I will nonetheless jump in to say that I would quickly choose the newborn mentally retarded baby to live and the zygote to die. That is obvious to me since the mentally retarded baby is a currently existing person vs. the zygote being merely a potential person. That zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present. I would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person (now merely a cell) to die.
That interpretation is fine except that God says, "I WILL make a helper suitable for him." He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.
Apparently you thought I was claiming that pro-lifers thought that the baby's life was more valuable than the mother's life. So I clarified:
Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it. 
Because he was found guilty of murdering a minor rather than an adult. Any crime committed by an adult against a child is more heinous in nature.
What Is a Human Person and Who Counts as a Human Person?: A Crucial Question for Bioethics by Prof. William E. MayThere is also an extremely academic school of thought which views the human person in terms of the ego in all its derivations. I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3 One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:
Actually, I believe it was a Reagan policy continued by both Bushes.
This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism.
Although i personally oppose abortion,i agree that two wrongs dont make it right.
Yes. The better question is, did it happen just like in Genises? I don't think so.
Out-and-out lie. There's really no other way to put this.
Yes yes, this was all covered in Wells' previous book, Icons of Evolution. It has been refuted numerous times (some even on this forum). See here for a thorough debunking.
Because I am one who likes see things from different angles. What better way to fight your enemies then to understand their viewpoint. Before I am attacked on the the last statement, just because I understand a viewpoint does not meant that I accept it as true or that I don't reject it.
Not many women would say they had an abortion now, let alone back when it was illegal.It is an emotionally trying event. I can understand why she wouldn't for that reason alone. Another possibility is that the Administration is buying her silence, or it could be a combination of the two.
This coming from the person that makes insane claims without providing evidence. Atleast provide some when asked!
You can not create the general from the specific, only the specific from the general
If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.
An independant perspective doesn't make it a good thing. Politicians that propose anti-gun legislation don't have to live in the real world with those of us that the bill will affect, they shouldn't be allowed to propose it.
I think you need to answer the same question I asked the other guy, who is God?
Just how do you suppose the government seeking permision would work in reality? And what exactly are you afraid of? It seems odd when people advocate blind trust for Joe Civilian, but then think that the government shouldn't be allowed to be armed. I think there must be a balance in trust given both ways.
Do you actually have any idea how science works? Why are you not embarrassed for creationism?
I see. So you can't give an example of a dinosaur being dated with carbon 14. None of us thought you could.
Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that "incipient organ" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying "what good is half a wing." Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does "fully functional" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.
They are both written in the bible. Neither of them have any evidence (apart from the bible) to support their existence. One of them has been proven to be utterly false. This naturally discredits the other, as they appear in the same publication by the same author. Why decide one is true when the other is clearly not, and neither have any other supporting evidence?
I'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch, and my uterus is perfectly healthy, thankyouverymuch (not that it is any of your emoticonXCensored business), and yes, I do plan to have a child in the future, and don't really care what you think about it.
Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.
Both. It's where a human life begins but not a life yet.
You're right, I think he has made such comments. Sorry. I think he's wrong and went too far.
You think "the unborn child is worthy of protection"..."but not more so than the mother, probably less"...yet you believe "in most circumstances the child should be carried to term?"
Yer lucky you ain't as old as me. They would have loved you with the M-1!
And Atilla's army of as many as 1/2 million men was beaten and forced into retreat by the Romans and Visigoths in 451AD. A year later, he was forced to make peace after devastating the Roman countryside...but NOT Rome itself.He died a year later in 453AD.
Oh it's no mistake Montalban. I, unlike you, am quite clear in my arguments, and have a direction and a goal. We can take your other definitions of creationism one at a time, thank you very much. I'd like to first focus on the one that involves your god, or any god, described as being unknowable (which you have said your god is). Will you "allow" us to focus on ONE thing? You see, if we have a list of 4 things, and we go through them one by one, we can maybe arrive at the end!!! Crazy thought isn't it!
I'm not sure where anyone said it related to evolution, the big bang, etc., but I might have missed something.
But it should be the job of science to establish a clear line between just where established fact stops and philosophy starts. There's no indication that they're getting it done.
You're working at the wrong end of the problem. We need young to survive. It's the old that are expendable.
But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not. And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits. Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution. Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution (along with every science) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism.
you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are. any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what "morals" should be drawn out of the biomorphs.
You don't have to be the best organism to survive. You just have to be good ENOUGH.
Well firstly we do not know that "volition" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it. I think you will find that there is NO valid reason for believing otherwise. And volition itself is NOT a defining characteristic of life. No biologist would buy that assumption. Sponges, bacteria, corn plants etc etc etc are mindless organisms and so far as can be determined do not act out of volition.
Just to be sure you understood, it was the picture below that picture you were supposed to look at.
And you believe that to be what? You really need to just say who/what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.
So what if he dislikes science? If he believes something else, he has the right to believe that way. My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others.
It doesn't matter whether it is religous or not. The odds of anyboy being fired over such a thing are slim to none. Morning after pills can not possibly make up eough of any given pharmacys revenue to make it worth the expense of replacing a skilled employee.
this statement isn't logical.It does not follow that if the person who creates the laws has to therefore follow them or can't change them...or even that they apply to him. If a teacher says "no talking in the classroom" it doesn't apply to the teacher now does it.
So please, feel free to leave this thread to those who DO wish to discuss the issue. No one is forcing you to discuss the topic of this or any other thread. I notice you evidently are not interested in "Understanding "Sexual Prejudice"" That is absolutely fine with me.Or are you now opposed to "Freedom of Speech" also?
Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments........
So then women who are pregnant shouldn't be allowed to   1) Smoke   2) Take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child   3) Drink   or do any otherwise legal action?   And VOR takes another giant step towards fascism.
But the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself. Justifying the validity of experience by experience is the intellectual equivalent of saying'God must exist, because God is good and would not allow a world without God'.
Oh, buddy, Atheism has EVERYTHING to do with that. The morality-less framework of Atheism ALLOWED them to justify the horrors that they inflicted.
I may be a pro-gunner but what doe's that have to do with with gay rights?   Since I'm a pro- gunner I won't force my life style or views on you,if you don't force yours on me.Deal?   After all you seem to be the expert on gay rights.
1 - It is innacurate. We allow killing in times of war, in self defense, and in state sanctioned executions. So we already have a situation where, when given X mitigating factors, it is justifiable to take a life. It is impossible to say all life is equal, and then to apply that as law. People will be outraged. I know I would be.2 - Objective to who? Who gets to decide how valuable life is? And why should they get to? And who says they are right? The relative value of life works fine, thanks very much.
Actually, as long as any group is not breaking laws, their ownership of guns is legal. The KKK can even own guns as long as the KKK is abiding by the law. I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups.
Don't you think this would fit the 'Creationism is nothing but lie's thread a bit better? Although I notice The Skeptic making disparaging remarks about your examples, it seems he attacks you more than deal with the well documented   examples you have.
But the big bang did not create matter. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. The matter was already there.You might just as easily ask if god was there to create the universe, where did this god come from.Your answer would be that god has always been there, but I would argue that the matter has always been there. The only difference between these theories is that mine has one less assumption.
Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist.
Yes, they do show a faithful devotion to the ultimate reality that there are no gods. You're an atheist, aren't you?
Please define "climb upward" and "downhill slide" in biologically meaningful terms. Please define "degeneration."
Considering your previous comment, that isn't you. Once again, that opinion is based upon who you read.
Steve - its not about qualifications - its about impact. Women are the ones who get pregnant, we should have more authority in the matter.
Having human DNA does not necessarily make one a human being. Transgenic animals can have human DNA, does that make them human beings.
Because you know the peer review process is biased. Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read. The scientific community's problems are just that big.
So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of? As I remember your posts have been censored several times by admin because you resorted to viscious personal attacks and name calling. And aren't you interested in the truth. Why isn't whether Jefferson said it or not important?
No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God.
And once it has begun, which would you rather have?
the blog is just the link for the article....geez, get a grip.
But it's not detecting any "new" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye, but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver.
With all the debt Obama has generated for our nation, he deserves to be filibustered into the ground. For too long the democrats had absolute power and ran amok and unchecked, answering to absolutely nobody and ignoring the will and the voice of the people.
The thing is the Dempski didn't provide any kind of testable or detectable definition about what information is either. He used vague but scienficially sounding terms to push his case. He knew it too.
George Bush won the majority of votes (the first majority winner in 16 years) in an election with the highest turnout in US history (>117Million voters). The Senate Minority Leader was defeated by a nobody. Democrats lost at least 3 seats in each of the House and Senate, something that never happens in a Presidential election year. This gave the Republican majority in both branches of Congress even more control. 11 Liberal ballot initiatives went down in flames by huge margins. If liberalism ISN'T dead, then it's in ICU on a heart and lung machine. emoticonXRolleyes 
Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.
Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment.
It is an acronym for 'Y'oung 'E'arth 'C'reationist. In other words... someone who believes that the earth is only 6,000 - 10,000 years old and was created in six days by a being known as God.
Well I guess Nato basically::p summed it up:Stupid is as stupid doe's.
And it is much easier to have an abortion than to be a mother.
It's one thing that stands between us and a mindless theocracy. It protects the freedom of women from would-be ayatollahs who would make them sexual slaves.
What are you talking about? Please define information. What does "new" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism.
But the law of angular momentum does not require that all parts of a spinning object spin in the same way now does it. If so then something like a rotary engine for an aircraft would not be possible!
No, not in the least. It's real intent was to throw a bone to the people pretending to have "family values". The religious right, the conservatives, that lot.
I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.
I believe the large majority of such deaths occur among inner city kids who don't know anything about guns except for what they see on TV and movies.
Huh? With a 26" barrel the .50 is good out to 2100 yards. With the 29 or 36 that increases to 2500, but the world record sniper shot was made with a .50 BMG and it was 2657 (1.51 miles).
Actually I don't deal with spanish or french because I don't have to. I speak english. emoticonXRolleyes
Preganancy should not be used as a punitive measure against women who are sexual. What you think is not reflective of the reality of women and their cicumstances that exist in the world. The reasons to abort are numerous and complicated. Some reasons are more valid than others. But you have no way of knowing that for millions of women, only they can really know.And although there are some youngsters in this forum who negate life experience, it is not to be negated. Ther is a lot to be said for "walking in a mile in another's shoes". Be careful about your desire to take the life circumstances of a stranger in your hands. Are you ready to be morally cuplable for the damage you could do?
Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.
I think a free society works better by saying "You have to have at least a certain variety to give your customers a choice in products". Businesses should have the restrictions, not private citizens.
That's not exactly true now, is it? People get to vote for elected officials, and that's all that's guaranteed federally. Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote. And of course there is no provision at all allowing the people to vote on federal laws. So in point of fact it is a true statement that in the United States someone is not allowed to vote on X, for some values of X.
How is that related to deterrence?       Once again, deterrence is preventing through the fear of consequences.      What you are talking about is not related to the subject of deterrence.
True, but what i was trying to state is that the bible has little to do with christianity if you dont believe in it. I know many christians who believe in god, and jesus etc, but think the bible is completely false, and is only a book of fables. Thats what i was trying to imply.
You know, I heard that from my mom last week. My parents moved to Arkansas when my dad retired a few years back. Mom thought it was amusing and disgusting that the state she moved to would have voted in such an alarming manor yet takes no measure to secure the marriages they already have. Ironic indeed.
You SERIOUSLY need to take a basic biology course so you can stop sticking your foot in your mouth emoticonXRolleyes An egg is NOT larva, and larva is NOT a caterpillar, and a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly - much the same as a zygote is NOT a embryo, and a embryo is NOT a fetus, and a fetus is NOT a baby, and a baby is NOT an adult. I challenge you to prove that a larva is exactly the same as a butterfly. If you can't even do something as simple as that, then you'll never understand the process/transformation of what a human has to go through, and THAT in and of itself should give you a clue as to how much in denial you are in, and how much you have to twist the truth around just to justify your version of events. Deal with it!
This seems to conflict with some of your earlier posts wherein you support terrorists.
And if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between? As they get closer, it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing. A principle comes in handy.
Would that work like the ban on illegal drugs in American? Does that ban keep illegal drugs out of American? The ban on illegal drugs does one thing, it does keep illegal drugs from law-abiding citizens. Law-abiding citizens are the only ones that respect the law when it comes to bans.
For me, this is like the idea that the speed of light was once very fast and has now slowed down. Both ideas indirectly call god a liar. This is bad. If all of our experiments show the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then that is how old it is. If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together.
The comic relief doesn't even recognize it has passed in on, or attempted to!
YES! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed. With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild (as england did). They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote. Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system. 
But you are forgetting life-without-parole (and I do mean WITHOUT parole). With life without parole, there is also no recidivism.
And there are plenty of people who smoke who don't develop lung cancer. You're cherry picking.
Right. And that is the reason for peer review. Creationists don't subject their ramblings to peer review. That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists. Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation.
A more precise term would be "broaden," since nothing about the definition pertaining to the people currently covered by it would be affected, "diluted" or altered in any way anyone has yet demonstrated. Nothing about the definition that pertains to people who already are, or can be married changes one iota. Their rights, benefits, and protections remain exactly the same. The only "change" would be to other  people, people who have no connection to, nor impact on, the marriages of anyone else: the gays who'll marry if the legal definition is broadened to encompass them. And the only "change" in that regard will be the fact that they are  encompassed by it, nothing more. No substantive aspect of the definition as it currently stands changes in the slightest.The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.
Excuse me, but you didn't fully read what he wrote. He didn't say that he supported abortion. He said that he wasn't as much a freak about it as you're being.
Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.
Well let me put it like this, I consider it your duty because if you don't protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else. Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government.
Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe.
And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation? I'd also like a link to verify what you say. Thank you. God Bless!
And yet you "and other women" feel free to impose their version of reality on innocent lives.
So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's "weak gun control laws" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?It seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to America, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons. They've got their own arms manufacturing plants over there, they can make whatever they need or want.
Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened.
The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the "quality of life" test.
Actually, I don't ask how the idea occurred. As I mentioned, Darwin suggested it. I'm not sure what the rese of that paragraph means.
Because everyone is equal in the eyes of the law, and rightly so. As for moral standing, you see no problem with equating his immoral behaviour with your own response. Most would.
Actually there is a better solution.   Mandatory male and female birth control pills, financial penalties if you stop taking. Anyone who would get off the pill would want a kid, therefore, abortions would cease.
I think you do not know what you are talking about. Your description fits the matter "god" you belive in.
Anyway Duo_Maxwell this isn't only creationist debaters, there are many more who do the same thing with different debates. you also forgot7. Make random accusations of logical fallacies when they have no idea what they even mean. Example: You said that my spelling is wrong, that's the biggest strawman I've ever heard8. Correct spelling mistakes and convienantly not answer the question. Example: "What do you thinkk of carbon dating?" "you spelled think wrong". If you want to correct spelling, fine but answer the question as well.
Yes because it is "officially" a life.Whether a person believes in life at conception or not they all agree it is life at birth and half way through life it is still life and right before death it is still life.If she does not want the child she can refrain from sex,use a contraceptive or abortion.If he does not want it he can refrain from sex (not likely for men),use a condom (not a guarantee to work),have surgery (hard to reverse) but that is it.So if he was to use a condom and get her pregnant she still has the last option.
Well, since you've called those who've disagreed with you here stupid (and variations thereof), and insinuated that they're too stoned to understand you, I think you have the most ground to make up. You also provide no support for your statements, most of which were debunked years ago as drug czar propoganda.
Ludacris and many others in the hip hop scene disrespect women with their lyrics and videos. Much of what hip hop puts out contributes to unwanted pregnancies.
You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.
You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.
But it, along with the uranian tapeworm hypothesis, is just as valid as intellegent design as a hypothesis. Actually, the uranian tapeworm hypothesis,. as far fetched as it may be, is more testable than a supernatural designer.I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is.
You mean that it must have has a beginning, don't you?
Yes, but if seen from space (something the ancients couldn't do) it LOOKS like it hangs on nothing. Don't worry, I don't mind spelling it out for you.
And I think that if I fall off a tall cliff, I'll die. Does that mean that gravity and science are either evil or incorrect?
Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time "channel" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.
You lost me there. Try them how and for what?
And here we have a leading YEC showing how he starts with his preexisting religious position and is not about to change it, no matter what the scientific evidences show.
Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.
Said like a cruel evil person who has no concern for his fellow man.
The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves.
And she was having unprotected sex? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility? Yeah, I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers.
That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory.
Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case.
No offense, but I am in my early teens and understand the situation more than you.
What's your point? Of course they will be bound by Heller just as the courts are bound by Roe v. Wade. That point wasn't in dispute. As long as you're talking about 19th Century Second Amendment case law, I like The State v. Buzzard (1842).
1) Charliegone's article was a published research article.I would love to know where "NARTH's" editorial was published, if it even was published.2) NARTH's article DID NOT show any "higher homosexual activity" because of legalized gay marriage.It thoroughly failed to show ANY rise in homosexuality in ANY "gay marriage" country. It showed some studies which were reportedly done in those countries, but that's it.
And how exactly do you propose this suggestion actually be enforced? Have you got it all thought out and prepared to defend in a debate, or are you just throwing out what the liberal loonies tell you is a good idea?
Sigh...for the ill informed who understand nothing about their religion. http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm
It is so the womans decision. If the baby is in the womb they haven't experience life, so how can they miss it. And if they are a so called "soul" then they will come out somewhere else.
So, you don't see how stating that in a functioning democratic society guns belong only in the hands of the state is not anti gun?? Maybe you could give us an example of a statement that is more anti gun that that because I am having trouble imagining one.
I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are.
I see no mention below of any judges in Mass.
Which of course says volumes. On the other hand such metaphors are appropriate in many cases. For example consider the vaccination program for smallpox which eradicated the disease FAPP. It was indeed a struggle and new tools and techniques were critical to reaching the objective. From Jenner to the end of the virus as a human pathogen.
And you will cowardly ignore the validity of the difference, as you whine that there is one ...A person goes to the doctor, that information is NOT public information. A doctor / patient can claim doctor/patient confidentiality. It's a recognized and valid situation.But with the "knowthyneighbor", these polls are PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. The purpose of publicizing them is to prevent fraud.If you weren't so intent on trying to bash, you would recognize the obvious distinctions... emoticonXRolleyes
Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.
And compare that to an equivalent sized human - if you compared the skill to a 10-13 year old boy, the erectus skeleton's cranial capacity would be significantly smaller. Doesn't contradict in the slightest other than the bizarre positions you decide other people should hold.
I know what you meant.My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply "vote" it out of existence. No need for the courts at all.
But your own link says that the rise in crime was partially explained by the new system the UK police were using for recording crime and that the British Crime Survey showed a decrease in crime since 1997.
You say that alot but discussion is about taking other people seriously.
But is the Red Cross Christian? Obviously most contributors are Christian. That's obvious as most Americans are Christian.
And your point was demonstrated to be specious using your own source. To contain strawmen even as you claimed it to be a strawman.
It wouldn't. Altering any of the fundamental universal constants changes them all. We wouldn't be considering some small change here and small change there. The universe probably wouldn't exist in any form.
Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.
How do you explain the change of appearance of the animals over time, as recorded by fossils?
That's not evidence, that's an assertion. As for my dogs (cats), yes. They do put on a winter coat in the much warmer winter climate than Arizona in which I live. So I return to my original question, on what evidence do you base your claim that an arctic fox would not change color in the winter in Arizona?
The Second Amendment does not apply to an Ohio Law. Thus, this ban is not unconstituitonal under the US Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, may however, protect gun rights, but I haven't read it.
I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification.
How do you know carbon dating is so accurate? Would you bet your life on it?
No, we shouldn't abolish every flawed system. However, when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death, it is not worth the risk.In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois, there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death. I think that constitutes a serious problem.
You know that, I know that, but the creationists do not know that.
I'm not trying to participate in gang debate, but well..The population of "people with heart trouble" would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce. If reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off.
People are protected by law from being harassed, assaulted and/or murdered because they are people. Not because they are a certain religion. Because they are people it would be wrong to allow such things.
I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.
Bad, bad, bad. :( 1) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment.1) Some, perhaps all "Livestock feed" is actually edible for humans; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico.2) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten.
Do me a favor. Write, in your own words, two paragraphs. One explaining the electromagnetic spectrum (and the visible spectrum's place in it), and one discussing rods and cones in the eyes.
Nonsense, societies change over time, therefore they evolve. Only biological populations evolve through natural selection and the theory of evolution only applies to biological populations, but the term "evolution" applies to other things too.
No, say you've got 200 of some species. By some event, 100 member are seperated. Now we have two groups of 100. Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.
No baby is more precious than another as far as my personal beliefs go it is no more alright to terminate a baby concieved through rape/incest than it is to terminate a baby classed as a mistake/inconvenience.
So, you're saying that you believe in absolutely everything your church believes and you support everything it does and the moment it did anything oustide of these you'd leave right?
It is disappointing that you would continue with this mistake. I said that God is both knowable and unknowable. You simply think that equates to the same thing, and thus you argue against what you believe I say, rather than what I said.
No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here.
It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific.
Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, "Turkana Boy" It is also sometimes called "Nariokotome Boy". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil.
Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion, as we all do. Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception. The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour. So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human' as and when it suits their purpose.Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like: some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human, then it IS. It isn't. It's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother. You can't deny that.Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue: in the meantime, the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body.
Old news. There have been accusations of similar stories for years.
What if the surgery for transferring the embryo/fetus would be equal in difficulty, risk, etc. to having an abortion? There would then be no extra physical cost incurred in keeping the embryo/fetus alive. What would be the reasons, in such a case, to keep abortion as an option?
Marriage is a secular condition set up by various Societies over the millenia and one of the prerequisites set out is that such a union should be between people of different genders.Religion has supported this and sanctified it but did not invent it.You don't curse the Church you lobby Society to see if you can effect a change. People who believe the different gender aspect are entitled to lobby for no change.
Same in the US. The father does not have the right to choose.
And people say I make strawman arguments.Simply put, not enough to justify your "concerns".
For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all.
Very sad news. I'm gonna have to say that if I was talking to the assemblyman that they quoted said that to my face, I'd tell the little bigot that his filthy viewpoint sounds exactly like the arguments used against interracial marriage, against civil rights for blacks, women, and various minorities, and also against ending slavery.
So if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence, and a devout Christian believes God is the highest form of intelligence, the Christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence?
How about getting the government out of marriage entirely? That is the goal of the libertarians, and maybe the liberals. No standards would be redefined if that happened, and gays would get their right to marry.
I believe that's true, and as a "believer" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be "with" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves "not with" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be "with" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist. 
Well, it showed how it was physically possible to generate amino acids from inorganic material. That's rather impressive. Again, irrelevant and unrelated to the Scientific theory of Evolution, regardless of you trying to create that association. Your continued attempt at doing so despite having been shown and told multiple times that the two are unrelated, well that only shows one thing, namely that you are dishonest.
Oh shut up! You're just sore because your side lost in the McDonald case and now you're left with absolutely nothing. You know that many gun laws are going to fall to the sword of justice, and you just can't stand the fact that your side is going to be brought back into check, just like any other.
The big bang, life from non-life, the progression of life from the simple to the complex, just to name a few. None of these can be proved (even on the balance of probabilities) to be true by operations science. All of these contradict scientific observations of the present. As a result, you must take them by purely blind faith.
I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.
The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow. Please give me one way those two things relate to each other.
I'm talking about the woman, of course. The fetus does not have a positive right to suck nutrients out of the woman's body against her will.
Well, not completely, but yes, quite the same. However, this is irrelivent- she wasn't a person, because she was in a coma. Does that give me the right to kill her? Of course not!   What about fetuses born in comas? Can we kill them?   What about people in vegetative states? After all, they arn't perfect, so let's kill them!
So what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions.
Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?
What laws are these that you speak of? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.
Dealt with. Wolves and dogs share a genus, not a species. Along with coyotes and jackels. See above for lots of transitionals, also.
Now everyone will know Marc was right all along--that there is an atheist science conspiracy.
How right you are to,and given the forum here, make it a crime to own to own a gun,well I think most of us are automatically criminals.It's like the signs you see...SHOPLIFTERS WILL BE PROSECUTED!lot a good they do.emoticonXBanghead,yeah know matter how illegal their will be crime.
You hear that cry...allowing gays to marry will cause the downfall of civilization...but you never hear "how" or "why"? More Chicken Little ####.
So you refuse to engage in an informal debate on the topic, but you all of a sudden are itchin' for a formal debate? How about you make the challenge?
That is a nice little pistol with lots of smack for only 11 onces. Also, I like DA automatics.
The issue of whether or not gay marriage is a 'human' / 'civil' right is begging the question ...
It isn't offered to make that assertion at all. It is offered to show that God values the life of the unborn if He will demand that a man responsible for causing its death in the womb be held accountable by paying the ultimate price.
Well, I didn't really mean to go that far. But I'm talking about problems like that all worked out, thought about previously, and that the problem was worked out. I'm talking more about, what if you could make laborers stronger, scientists smarter, and rid us of physical and mental abnormalities ( such as down syndrome, narcolepsy, etc.). I don't think of making everyone the same for that reason. I'm just saying, what if there was a way to better society without going overboard? If the problems were worked out, which I'm sure they will be, what would your moral view on it be?
I suggested nothing. You are reading into this some thing that is absent. "The nurse then informed me, if I had answered yes to any of the questions, I would have lost my concealed carry permit as it would have gone into my medical records and the VA would have reported it to Homeland Security. Looks like they are going after us vets."
But even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat. The heat generated by the creation of the mountains of the world would be more than enough to reduce the entire surface to molten lava. Add to that the fact that the condensation of the "vapor canopy" would release enough heat to boil all of the water on earth. 
Oh no, I completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is. Your continuing to compare the ID concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more. That and the fact that you referred to the flying spaghetti monster seven times in your last post.
Well, "reasonable" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?
In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.
Actually, my wife and I discuss evolution all the time. She's an evolutionary biologist. She did feel as if she had some duty to watch the show, just to stay on top of the sorts of things being said. She just has a low tolerance for willful stupidity. Which I totally understand. :)
No Ted Kennedy is not a fundie but Vitter is. For God sake the pope is a nazi and a fundie.Marlene Elwell, the nazi *itch, who put the evil mariage amendment on the michigan ballot is a Roman Catholic also. If you are a christian and you believe in the suppression of homosexuality then you are a fundie and a christianist.
Even new Justice Sotomayor, who claimed she ruled by precedent will be bound by the Heller Decision if she remains true to her purported philosophy. The debate between Sui Juris and Res Judicia should no longer be an issue with the liberals on this RIGHT! It either applies to all or it applies to none which would result as Justice W.O. Douglas wrote: "a revolution". It is in the government's (federal especially) best interests to keep our soldiers employed in foreign countries. BTW, I think the court decision in Nunn vs. State of Georgia did the best summation of this right!
Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again.
If guns laws don't affect criminals then how do you explain the low rates of criminal gun use in nations like the UK?
So it is claimed.   Tiahrt Amendment Facts | ProtectPolice.org   I've noticed a pattern. Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so. They send a mixed message. It's happened before such as when the NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF. How can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better? It gives us a clue to what the gun lobby's true motives are. Truly disturbing.
You were crowing a bit. What I don't understand is why. How could you possibly be pleased by some strangers religious views. Would you have been pleased if he switched to liking broccoli? (Or disliking as the case may be)
Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity? It sounds to me that this "new" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find. ...*Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected inthe adapted strains.*... 
This is actually humorous coming from you who has absolutely no concept that you are a spiritual being, or the extra dimension of yourself which that reality means to you. In other words antonia, It is the epitome of self deceit to lie to oneself about who they are. And you define that darkness which is the great lie you represent so completely.
And we know this how? You complain about the 90% figure being erroneous and then make an unsupported statement like this?Furthermore, if Mexico is making an earnest attempt to smash the cartels and we're financing it in part, wouldn't we want to help reduce the weapons traffic flowing south into the cartel's arsenals?
Well, it seems pretty evident that you have know idea of the meaning of the word theory when used in science.
Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by "friction".By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation.
No it means that the genome operates in a more complex way than was previously believed. It does not mean that "life is irreducibly complex" since that term is not even sufficiently well defined to test the assertion. And given the scattering of information into many pieces I would say that more and more it looks like "pieces that happen to be fitted together". More and more like a complex kludge. Exactly what one might expect to find in an evolved system rather than a designed or deliberate or intentional one!
It's been reported in the Telegraph as well as several other news outlets. Want to slander them as well or do you want to try to disprove their story based on its content. I suggest the former, because the University has already confirmed the authenticity of the e-mails and documents. emoticonXRolleyes
Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today.
I think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited. Space, time, energy, matter and laws all came into existence together. Of course that's impossible for us to envisage....
You don't beleive that it is possible to do something wrong to prevent a larger number of wrongs in the future? Do you think the ends can ever justify the means?
No you haven't. You expressed your opinion but refuted nothing.
Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'.
And yet this is what they fossil record shows. There is alot of information floating around on the uses of feathers for insulation, hunting techniques, display etc before flight.Half a feather might not be as good for flight as a "fully developed" one, but dinosaurs had them and they probably were able to glide, albeit poorly, with them. Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were "totally useless", is simply false. Evolution works on adapting already functional structures for different functions.
I don't see why it is so hard to accept he lied. He lost is award and lost his job over his data.
Do you mean someone who was wrong? I asked you before to give an example of where Newton found empirical evidence of God. You failed to do so. I suspect that you can't.
I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. "Evolutionism" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world. The conflict of opinion arises out of the importance of the detail- can Genesis be accepted as a parable which contains a fundemental truth or must it be taken as a historical account?
You answered the first one already... it is a 'cartoon'. It showed that just as one was out-lawed, the other was born. You decide what to believe from this.By the way..."Lockheed Martin is a global leader in the design, development and production of missiles and missile defense solutions for the United States and its allies around the world. The goal: Defend against attacks by ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and other airborne threats."http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/fi...=0&ti=0&sc=400
Oh never mind that such a condition would be toxic...not to mention that no ice cores support such magical ideas.
I'm not moving the goal posts, this is just your attempt at intellectual dishonesty. Heller was about an individual right protected in the Constitution, Dred Scott wasn't. Therefore these two cases aren't comparable anymore than cotton candy and scrap metal.
And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay.
One shouldn't assume ignorance on the part of creationists. That is a mistake that too many evolutionists make.   In the real world, we have people willing to say things they already know isn't true. Why should creationists be any different? After all, they are people, too. But rather than accept that fact, evolutionists argue that creationists are ignorant of a subject when, in reality, they (creationists) were simply telling lies.
So Minnesota is the one state Ohioprof was referring to?
Well, all I can say then is that no action is just about as bad as failed action, and IS as bad in terms of anything current. Either way you don't have gay marriage. You have a majority in Congress right now, and you're not demanding much change just because of fear of backlash? Yeah, there would be backlash. Heck, the Civil War was the ultimate backlash, but that didn't stop abolitionists from demanding more than TOKEN change, and it's a good thing they did. It's your gig, though, so do what you want. I don't see much point in laboring this discussion any more; I'm just pointing out my observations.
When was the last mass murder at a UK university then?
Atheism doesn't have that standard because it's not that encompassing a thought. All athiesm is, is a lack of theism, period. It says nothing about morals or ethics. Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.
But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with "philosophical pronouncements" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond "atheistic philosophical pronouncements."
Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory. Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved.
Quite frankly, you don't know squat about me. So stop trying to pretend you do.I have gone on record to say I think Christianity does a lot of good in the world.I have even tried to correct Matthew in his anti-Christian tirades. (Until I gave up realizing it would do no good... emoticonXFrazzled )I hate to break it to you, but the WORLD typically functions with people putting out negative news.You hear about how Joe XXXX broke the law.Do you ever hear about how Johnny Atlas keeps the law?emoticonXFrazzled
Hmmm... He may get things right only when he thinks getting it right contradicts evolution...
Falling, the fact that the homeschoolers you mentioned don't choose to socialize with you, doesn't mean they're not far more capable of functioning in the "REAL WORLD" than you might think. I would not choose to socialize with you in the "REAL WORLD", and you most likely would not choose to socialize with me, but that does not make me your social inferior!
Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.   You are out of your league.
You are very right. We too will have to pay tax on the insurance for me. Not fair.
There is no need for prey animals to grow a third or forth eye as a defense mechanism. Binocular vision works. Its balanced and can render 3d positioning in the mind accurately. The lizard that you mentioned is born with a spot sensitive to light which helps the body absorb vitamin d, as humans do due to skin that is light-sensitive to a certain extent. It isn't an eye for defending against predators, and it doesn't need one. As for insects, the fact that they've survived for such a long time goes to show that they have adapted adequately and are doing well. Have you tried sneaking up on a fly lately?
I think perhaps you're confused.1. I know of no meaningful definion of the term "god' as it pertains to reality.2. When you mention science and history, that implies you are interested in reality.3. There is no evidence to support mythological deities, god or God or Odin or the easter bunny.* So, yes THERE IS NO EVIDENCE of the existence of any mytholgoical gods.** Yes, there is no evidence that the universe was created, or if that statement even has meaning if the universe always was, and always will be.p.s. There is easter bunny.-Mach
Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.
Yet according to PP themselves, they provide FAR more abortions and EC services than any of their other services. :PPPFA Services (2002-2003)Surgical abortions: 227,385 Emergency contraception: 633,756 Prenatal care: 15,860 Adoption referrals: 1,963 (Source: www.plannedparenthood.org)
No I shouldn't be fighting against abiogenesis, I'm for unrestricted freedom to explore it all!
Actually I didn't even read it (and doubt I ever will). Don't get all worked up over it.
So what you are saying is simply that the genes do not actively control the body.What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence.
Why didn't they "fire" and "bar" him in the sixties?
Actually, creation explains nothing. Evolution is an observation that is explained by theories that explain why populations of animals change. One explanation is the theory of natural selection.
it can't always be cared by anyone. What if no one wants the baby or you can't get to a place where you can give the baby up (maybe snowed in for a week). Can you kill the baby then because it is now dependent on you.
Well of course it's about petitions that would lead to amendments. What else would it be about? Nevertheless it is still a voting process. That's how amendments are done. What I'm asking is, does this bill mean that ANY issue that could come up as an amendment would be illegal? And if not, (the more important question) how would they determine what constitutes civil rights. (Which you didn't answer, but rather basically said 'I don't know but rest assured they do' (to paraphrase). Get it now? Anyway, on further review, I believe that the bills only apply to whatever falls under the catagory of 'civil rights', however the heck that is to be determined! emoticonXDonno 
Too late, drug usage has already created those epidemics. Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily, but they already exist. I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain.
Not at all. The theory of evolution contains many many things.
Evolutionary scientists is a confusing term. A geochronologist might work out an age for a lava sample for example. Astronomers have also made comment on the age of the earth as have paleontologists studying certain fossils.So why would no flood make radiometric much more likely to accurate as you say? Can we hear some specific detail on this as it is kinda significant to backing you your assumption.
But the sea and sky are the same regardless. I would say the sailor conceives the information with language. He infers the information with language.
And like the police , the Navy could plan and execute raids.
Your statment is like saying we evented 2+2= 4. We did not envent it, it aways existed. Same with logic, its a concept that exists apart from the meterial universe. But in the atheists worldview, only the meterial universe exists.
See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.
Homo-erectus and Neandertals had different bone structures. How could they be fully human when their anatomy is fundementally different?
A little of both. Japan is known for allowing its police officers to physically and mentally torture suspects and deny them legal counsel if they determine that such counsel will interfere with their interrogation. Suspects aren't allowed to read confessions before signing them either.Is that what Penfold really wants?
BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry. Any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed.
The process of evolution has no scientifically known teleology and follows no known predestined plan. It does not teach that there cannot be any such things as teleology or forethought. This is where your mistake lies.
No-one experiences the existence of an outside world. Explanations such as the Matrix can explain sense impressions as well as some concept of 'external reality'. We have no more evidence for one than the other.The fact no-one takes them seriously is a psychological point about human beings, nothing to do with reality per se.
Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA.
Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.
The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough. 
Just as soon as peddler's cheek stops stinging and he picks the glove up...
So were the officers on the front lines of the Mumbai massacre. But they didn't shoot back, they hid like cowards. They let people get killed for no good reason.
So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.
Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.But, do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang?Or do you think that the Big Bang didn't happen?
Actually I'm so sure of my manhood that even though I knew that charge would be levelled against me I still posted anyway. Anyway if you feel that men need to be degraded to make up for past actions to women you have gone from "righteous" to bitter.
Nope. And since the melanic form is the dominant allele, your point is moot.
So the intent hiding behind abortion laws all along was to keep women in the gutter. There was not any legititamte concern for the unborn fetus. It was all about how they could keep women down. Tell me then, would someone who supports a ban on partial birth abortion do so simply because they want to repress women?
GREED but what you fail to admit is that that standard of living comes at a price for someone.
think of it as a photocopy of a check for a million dollars. yes the copy is in the image and likeness of the original check, but it is not the check. you cannot cash the photocopy, regardless of how accurate the copy is, it is not the check, only an image of it. that doesn't mean anything is "wrong" with the original, and it doesnt mean that the copy has to have all the properties and function of the original. its just an image
My life was a gift from my parents, no more, no less. When i look in the mirror, i do not see an embryo. If someone gives you something, they have every right to take it away if they feel you are not suited to handle it, or if they had second thoughts. I would think this was ok if the baby was stopped in an earlier stage, but once its in its third trimester, you have no right to kill it.
Sucide? Isn't that a mental health issue? If you take a gun from a sucidal and depressed person, does that cure depression?   If it does that you have addressed the root cause of sucide.   If it does not than you really have not done anything to cure the fundamental cause of sucide.
Yes, it is interesting how we draw an arbitary "legal line in the sand" with regards to determining how late into a pregnancy an elective abortion is available.
I think bringing "emotions" into the question of whether God exists or not tends to cloud the issue a bit.Isn't the essence of atheism a rational enquiry which concludes that in the absence of any credible evidence, there is no reason to believe in God ? An emotional attachment to "non-belief" would be irrelevant (and irrational).
I don't see anyone without healthcare. None of my friends, none of my family, none of my neighbors. ZILCH. NADA. NAUGHT. CIPHER.   Now I don't go wandering around the inner cities looking for half-crazy winos and crack addicts either, so maybe that's why.
pro-choice is only pro child if the choice is not abortion and they are only pro family when the choice for family. So really pro choice can be pro child or anti child and pro family or anti family.
I'm sure the racist white segregationists after Plessey thought exactly as you do now, "That settles the matter."Little Louise Brown had a big SURPRISE!!! for them.You still have not walked upon the thin ice of the "well regulated" wording, we note.
The only person who can take away your sin is God. No human can ever cleanse himself of his sins, so get over it.
And that part of the decision (not allowing for the woman's health to be taken into account) is why I do not agree with nor do applaud this decision (in fact I am rather disgusted with it). If you'd like to see a more concise view from me, you can see the thread that Another_opinion started here: http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/9678-mothers-health-exception-where-do-we-draw-line.html
The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true.
I know ... I know. I agree with you that it's sad more of those people couldn't or didn't take advantage of concealed carry to help prevent so many deaths. That needs to change along with education so more people can defend themselves.
Actually, that's not true. While all of the sciences actually support one another, one can be a chemist and not accept evolution. One can even do good science without accepting evolution, but it is difficult. For example, cosmology, astrophysics and astronomy see a very old universe. That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution.
Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose.And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves?And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around...What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol...But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content.
Could you perhaps define "teleology" as you understand it and say why you believe there is teleology in the universe?
I think your idea has merit. However, before I would fully endorse it, I am interested in how you see it being implemented and administered from the standpoint of equal protection under the law.
I know what you mean. You should see some of the other "books" he has at his site as well.Well, now we know that Muslim creationists are even nuttier than Christian creationists, but both still use the same twisted ideas and concepts to justify their pseudo-science of creationism (Read: Religious beliefs). ;)
Ok, now I'd like to know why Lappster thinks evolution has anything to do with morality? Do you actually know what evolution is Lappster?
Actually, this guy was an ex-con. It's illegal for a convicted felon to own firearms. Galileo actually helped us more than he helped you. This proves once again that criminals will always refuse to surrender their weapons.
And an even funnier thing is it won't affect his wallet at all.
I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.
To be more accurate, (not something noted amongst the pro-gun rabble) the right of protestants to have arms for their defence against catholics.I think we've all seen quite enough of this "defence" in Northern Ireland. (assuming that yanks can locate the place with a map emoticonXRolleyes )
How is that conclusion derived at? The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child. And the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law. So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that, there is no question.
BWAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH![/QUOTE]So you are saying that my DNA reflects the fact that I live in Texas?
What's "cumulative selection?" Do you mean a series of mutations with small but beneficial influence that occur over the period of thousands or millions of years? Just how do you propose to observe such mutations? In fact, we can observe such mutations by comparing the genomes of related species.
You bring up a very interesting point.   All those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well. When polled, residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions.   So, not only are the anti's disingenuous as far as what they promoted, but were so in HOW these amendments were promoted.
Because we view it as something much more than just a gravy train from the govt., that's why.For you it seems to be about the word, and the govt. saying "oh, you use THAT term ("marriage"), ok we recognize it." For us it's about the commitment.
Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.
You are missing the entire point (again). Why do you feel ashamed? Because you know that what you did is bad. I have heard from a great Australian war hero, one of our remaining ANZACs soliders (recently passed away I think) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun (WWI era) and he saw him die that it was "the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure". He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life. He knows that he did something wrong, but it was a war, and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen. You are way off the plot. But let us continue.
They are not exactly the same. See the examples above. It is not random.
I agree it's a threat to us but the point is whether it's really caused by increaing amount of carbon dioxide and how big the threat is.Maybe global warming is just a part of process of global climate change which occured several times long time ago, ie, ice age things like that.As far as I know, global warming is one of the catastrophe which leads to extinction of human beings. However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.
Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had. 
Funny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed.
I have noticed he seems content to drop a Ad Hominem neglecting to actually argue.
Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?
Nope. Frame-shifts move the whole code down one step, making entirely new genes. Often, this is disastrous, but sometimes, a useful new enzyme results.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.
And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?
And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years. The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s.
Oh? They're trained to deal with irate exhusbands who are stabbing their wives and dousing them in gasoline, in broad daylight, in the middle of a busy parking lot? They're trained to deal with that specific kind of #### every single day?
Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to "polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it." Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it.
Since when were proteins no longer structures? A basic freshmen tool for teaching is the phrase "structure defines function."
Really? What a surprise! So tell me. If you don't know what it is or how it works, how do you know that you are opposed to it?
Hardly any criminals go armed in England, and certainly not with guns. Burglars and muggers have enough sense to know that while getting done for burglary or mugging will not be pleasant, getting done for burglarly or mugging AND possession of a firearm will be far, far worse, assuming they survive the arrival of the armed response squad.
I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard.
In my reading of the Declaration (and using the 1st. Amendment as a filter) it doesn't matter who or what the founders meant by "Creator." The conlusion is the same; regardless. Namely; The fact that the founders considered our basic rights to be inherrent.
Actually we do not know who the first human to get AIDS was. Most likely it was an African who got it from a green monkey last I looked into the matter, most likely by eating the creature. You are perhaps referring to case zero, but thats only as far back as the chain can be traced, its not the first case in humans.
and how do you know this......oh I see...you said "I think"....but you don't really "know" what most Americans favor or don't favor...you just "think"
Just another example of using a verse meant for personal use and applying it to wars. Sorry, just doesn't work that way.
ZERO. I don't think he ####ed one African. Unless you can demonstrate otherwise, your statement is false.
What is incredible is that this is probably the most enlightened response I can expect from this crowd.
In your first post. If you are to qualify that by stating I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life over the ontogeny of an individual then of course reproduction is not essential character of life.
ummm... the death penalty has always been around. i never claimed that death was the penalty for every crime, nor that it was the most common punishment. try to catch up
When is wealth redistributed on a whim? The NHS is one of the few good things to come out of WWII and is the mark of a fair society (if you ask me). Restricting health-care according to wealth is despotic....
But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural.
Working on it. Apparently we are still waiting for to to be graded (it was really big, at leat 20 typed pages). I plan on buying from them when they get it back, and maybe putting up a whole page in honor of it. Partly because I think it is very telling, partly because I remember what it was like to be in college and get a little recognition for your work.
If you think that it's OK when the Mother's life is in danger. Why wouldn't it be OK when her life isn't in danger?
And those pillars will be replaced by something stronger like equality and Justice.
This argument is self-defeating. A theory is not a fact, no matter how much evidence may support the theory. Bad wording. But again, if you claim something as a fact, you must have proof, verified in both your method of reasoning, and the reasoning utilized by the person you are proving the fact to.
They do it on purpose, alright. But not because it'll be shot down -- in at least one state, the Supreme Court decided that similar legislation did not address more than one issue.The reason they put them together is that, in most states, a ban on civil unions would FAIL.
Strawman. The argument is not to do whatever one wishes with ones body. The argument is soley that one does not have to have another attached, ever, against ones will.
They originally might have been an arbitrary guess, but experience of all humans always has given them a very high probability of being true (at least the existence of the outside world, the others are abstract logical concepts that don't have a physical reality, just an abstract one).
Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.
The man seemed have a thing about prostitutes. I believe he felt it was his God-given destiny to punish them.Cybererratus is a very interesting persona. He manifests a number of very interesting character traits. I don't believe that he likes women very much. In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling.
No, everyone should have those regardless of marriage. You're the one here who seems to think straight and gay marriage should be a litmus test for those things.
It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers. To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous.
Oh, boy... here you come with your anti-religious bigotry rhetoric, who mentioned one thing about religiosity? C'mon Simone... let's coddle those little bats of common sense back under the belfry of reason where they are supposed to roost... They didn't need laws against it back then because peopel had more human dignity and respect for human life... and they responded within the realm of decency and basic propriety. It is a shame we actually have to go there...
Exactly and if you accept that animals have been on the Earth for millions of years then why can't evolution be a process that God created and controls?
Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born. And as I've said, there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption.
It's possible that Archaeopteryx is not a direct descendant of modern birds but it's certainly not far from the line and it shares both avian and therepodian characteristics.
If that's truly what the organization says, then it's a hypocrite of an organization.
And from this we are to infer that Leakey doubts human evolution? There is by now a huge variety of fossil hominids. If Leakey was admitting that it was difficult to be certain which were or were not directly ancestral to modern humans, this is no more than scientific honesty.
This is absurdity. I suppose then that medicine should wreak my body. How about viruses? Am I destroyed by them?
So what is your point? Are you claiming that the tenets of christianity are in doubt because the several thousand denominations hold contradictory views? Science proceeds by challenges and contradictions. Contradiction in science is not evidence of doubt but evidence of a field of advance. In religion, it is without question, a matter of the veracity of the ultimate truth. Which of the thousands of christian faiths hold the truth?
Well, at least accoreding to your "because I say so" belief. The woman, of course, don't need to pay attention to your desire to control her own body in bondage to your particular brand of outraged morality.
Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.
Well, what faults? You say that innocent people are sentenced to death far too often. Well, the death penalty does not sentence people, our judiciary system does. The death penalty is mearly a punishment. I will agree that some innocent people have been sent to death row, and when their innocence was discovered, they were released. A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals. 
Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't "on the grounds," although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property. It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district. The children go to the seminary on released-time, which has been found to be constitutional (although I don't see how).Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are:McCollum v. Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306)McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that "accommodating" religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not.
Well then what the devil are you moaning about then? It's not like Browning shot King, or actually made the rifle that was used or anything like that. Hell it wasn't even a rifle made by the Browning company.There's absolutely no connection between the two for you to be bitching about.
Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said "You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term." I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted.
So?I look into the clouds and see a cow. Clouds aren't telling me to have a steak.
This joke is based on some reality, "the conquest of the North Pole is traditionally credited to Anglo-American Navy engineer Robert Edwin Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909.   Anyhow, not all jokes are completely true, how many stand up comedians have you heard??? If you were to nit pick every joke out there (being politicaly correct etc) there would be no jokes left!
What would you know about fair and balanced?emoticonXCensoredI know a lot of truths about gays. Do you want me to start posting incessant threads pointing them all out?And I am the moderator for the formal debate forum, not the entire board. Want to debate me on the benefits of gays on society vs Christianity?
Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.
Actually Archie it was neither left nor right. he went after both democrat and republican and took a center tone to the entire issue at hand. Portraying the reality of the suffering of his hometown due to jobs leaving the US and the greed on wall street.
That is what it said. Now your website gives a false translation to this. It clearly is talking about if the unborn is harmed.Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person (in the Christian faith) is formed before conception! This shows that God has already created you. God also talks about how you can't kill a person he created. This is an easy concept to follow.I suggest if you wish to learn what the Bible says you read it and not take what a biased website has to say. Religioustolerance.org is a joke that misleads people into making God what they want him to be.
I think you are the same person as usa all the way and again.. you have no right to talk about murder because you murder the english language everytime you post.And no.. the baby does not belong to god because there is no baby and I don't know if there is a god or not. Btw.. I'm not going to incubate something in my body because of you think it's wrong because someone who may or may not exist said so.
And I see you still flip back and fourth from being an atheist to not being an atheist.
Those who set the rules can do with them as they please. It isn't illogical nor hypocritical. It IS illogical to assume you can chew gum if the rule is "you cant chew gum" and the teacher allows one student to chew gum.
Pandion has already pointed out that this isn't a theory, it's a mode of wishful thinking. More damagingly, however, if you examine it for more than a moment it doesn't even fulfill the role you give it. You say 'many things in nature make no sense without God', but how do god's origins and nature make sense? Where did he/she/it spring from? All you do by invoking god as an 'explanation' is push the problems one step further back. The god hypothesis may look like an explanation, but it is not.
And here you reveal your prediliction for reading what you want to see into the words of others. I described materialism embracing new forces and phenomena which have withstood the rigors of the scientific method. I explicitly described science as a methodology, not a philosophy. You are wrong about me, WW, and the longer you pretend otherwise, the more time you're going to waste on strawmen and the more chances I'm going to get to make your arguments look silly. It's up to you. Argue with me, or argue with the person you want me to be.
oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you "think" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.
Sounds pretty neat. I've never been there but I'll keep it in mind for a road trip some time.So you are of the belief that dinosaurs and man lived at the same time? I know that there are people who believe in this but I don't come across them very often. So what information do you have to share with us about this idea?
Among other things, generally adaptions to a colder environment.    As for your theory as a whole, doesn't the whole 15, 000 year gap between the extinction of the Neanderthalls and the development of farming (particularly the grains youre talking about).
So when you're doing math, you're an atheist? Of course not. Just because there is overlap doesn't mean that the two views are identical.
No one mentioned helping or not helping people here, or even dealing with the consquences of pregnancy at all. Its more;'If abortion were banned, what measures or research would you suggest to reduce the pressure for people to have illegal ones or unwanted pregnancies'.
Just like the Brady Campaign. Often when trying to paint concealed carry holders as dangerous individuals, most instances they cite either never had a concealed carry permit to begin with, or the matters of the case were instances that lacked mens-rea and weren't crimes to begin with.
That's obviously not what is said. The sun's energy is not claimed to be a mechanism that makes order of disorder. What it does do is override the tendancy within the 2LoTD where total usable energy in a system decreases.
Can we get away from quoting 5 year old posts? Seriously, if you don't take the time to actually read the thread why should I respond to your post?
They have changed. For example, ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species, while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species (actually, two or three species). And the differences are enough to put them in different families.By the way, ark guy, what do you know about taxonomy?
Logical truths do not come from "somewhere", your question makes as much sense as "What time is a moose?".You do not appear to have read my post at all, variously repeating what I have said and addressing things I did not say.
Obviously that is the case. We cannot simply say that a certain God exists and have it be so.
A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.
What do you mean by other definitions? Before you stated "Creation is...." thus it is implicit in this that you are arguing against a single homogonous construct. And it's embarrassing for you to realise that there's actually as much variance of opinion in this, as in evolution.
Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either.
And science helped Stenger write his book. How can the same subject make a stronger case for both of two completely opposing viewpoints?   another
That's certainly your right, but supersport is interested in hawking a religious agenda, not a scientific one. He may want it disguised as a scientific one, but a perusal of his posts here bely that desire.
They do not. They offer increased thermal protection and thus make a greater range of habitats possible. Feathers also offer increased protection from attack. They are so good that several native American cultures were known to make armor from feathers. They absorb and spread impact quite well.Feathers don't itch and they don't rustle in the bush.Do you have an answers that aren't examples of shallow thinking?
False and that doesn't invalide evolution given how it's a misrepresentation of one of the statements in the theory.       Gould can take his comments and shove them up his ***.
There are no objective reasons to condemn gays. Marriage is not a matter of state and so it is meaningless to argue whether a state should recognize it.My advocating of perfect liberty allows no contradictions or exceptions, believe me I have lost alot of support from conservatives for this, perhaps even gays if one really applied it to all extremes.
And only a "miniscule and negligible fraction of the total wild moth population" has even been observed resting anywhere else. Despite my explanation of his mathematical misleading, wabbit continues with it.Some of you with better short-term memory might remember that I stated that there is little debate that many of Kettlewell's experiments were imperfect. wabbit has posted some excerpts to this effect, but really, all we need to do here is realize that wabbit has quote mined to his little heart's content. Here's a portion he purposely excised:
Some references please? In general, it seems that most climatologists agree that severe weather systems will occur more frequently with an increase in average global temperature. (ref:http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/061.htm#1434)
This applies only when men strive...that is fight. If a man "Accidently" hits a woman while in a fight and causes her to lose her child then all he has to do is pay a fine. But if he keeps fighting and hurt other people he gets killed. Even in the Bible you dont get punished so severly on accidents.
This is a push to promote lawlessness. The San Francisco fiasco is the prime example. People with certain agendas are refusing to follow the laws. This is a devastating precedent for our Nation.
With regard to this statement you have to consider:1. How can anyone know what product an "intelligent designer" wanted.2. Even from the example of life on Earth we can clearly see there is nothing easy at all about the path life has taken over the millenia.But I think it is possible to hold your position, although it can be a tricky one by virtue of the entrenchment of opinions that has occured in the religion science debate- due to the less than pragmatic attiudes of some of the participants.
Well, one person got it right...where in the constitution does it say something about health having to be protected?
The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life.
I think a more telling question would be, why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe? It seems completely idiotic to me.   Smiley
Why can't you answer questions directly?anyway, I support ct in passing civil unions or marriage lite as I like to see it, but It doesn't confer equality. If it is really equ8al than it would be marrige. Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that, but we don't so far and we cannot ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage.)If it is good for straight couples, it should be equally good for all couples. . No one is more superior. Everyone should be equal. Marriage for all is equals.
And then there's this:Alarm at routine patrols by armed police - Crime, UK - The Independent
And depending on what human is "finding the answers" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings.
That's good. You're right, all we can do is hope and pray (I pray for things like this every day, and in a way, God has answered my prayer in this case).
And melting the entire surface of the earth and boiling the oceans. Even creationist who propose the nonsense that you spout admit that they have no way to explain where the heat went. In an effort to answer where the water went, they encounter the problem of explaining where the heat went.
You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to.The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable. The promised veto threat didn't matter in this instance. He was "standing on principle." Well, same would apply for his newfound views disfavoring DOMA as well in my view.
It hasn't been proven that the Second Amendment is solely about tyrannical governments and not about dealing with violent criminals.
You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said "can" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean "will", "must", or "shall" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it "CAN" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun.
And if someone had written an ad proclaiming that black Americans are inferior the same thing would have happened as well. I can't justify what they did but when you put such a hot-button issue out like that into the open...it has to be expected. People have strong feelings about abortion rights (just like racism) and it is naive to think something like this wasn't going to happen.
To point our an error, i believe the baby was at the infant stage, not the toddler.
There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored. Those that haven't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about. There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred. Those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles, are dubious at best, and are extremely rare. A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens. The point I was making is that if they existed we would see them.
Well, it depends on your definition of retarded I guess. The standards to get a drivers license are really not that high. Think of how dumb the average person is, and realize that 50% of people are dumber than that. Kinda makes you cringe.   And you wonder what has prevented me from being in an accident? Well, perhaps the fact that I am a concientious, defensive, and skilled driver who excercises caution while on the road. Maybe next time someone pulls out in front of me, I should just throw my hands in the air and scream "take the wheel jesus!" I am sure some magical being will fly down from heaven and save me from crashing. Yeah...sure.
I'll assume this is figurative since they do not literally melt.
It won't. I'd think any responsible parent with a teen under the age of 18 who has a sound relationship with that teen would discuss the possibility of her becoming sexually active (a normal function in spite of some puritan attitudes) and offer simple avoidance of possible pregnancy and abortion. Like vehicle insurance she may never need it, but going without either one is plain stupid.
Actually, the storm lasted for 40 days and 40 nights. The ark was actually afloat for a year or so. So I guess the answer is that the ark had all kinds of pestilent insects winging about and biting and stinging the occupants. The problem is, how did these aquatic breeders actually propagate in the feces and urine infested bilge of the ark?
Again, you are the affirmative, you must support your claims. Please support the claim that we are using an atheist presupposition. I think we are using more an agnostic presupposition, which is a neutral one.
And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks, and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property. I suppose (but am not familiar enough with all of the details to know for sure) that some even used the Bible to justify linching blacks.
Congratulations. You are now part of a minority group. Marriage tends to either work or it doesn't. I know, brilliant observation. What I mean is either the couple is together for decades or spend x amount of years being unhappy until the unhappy is more than the baggage of divorce.
I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.
Well, we'll ignore the fact that you think dinos are the same as modern day reptiles, and we'll ignore the fact that you are assuming that what goes today must have gone before (something you rant against on a daily basis). Who said anything about reptiles or dinosaurs?
A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology).
Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?   Please, that's just pathetic.
No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation.
First off, define "government funded". The FBI? The CIA? Other federal law enforcement agencies? The military? All vital government entities that are and should be armed. The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government.
how many animals do you think were on the Ark? how many species existed at the time?      the story of the ark does not coincide with contemporary science, but it does work with the rest of Genesis. this is Genesis 2: 15-23
Actually the majority of homosexuals will tell you it's not a choice. And I, being the wacky gal I am, have a tendency to believe the word of homosexuals on that particular subject over the word of straight neonazicons.
You know 'my kind'? How very presumptuous on your part. Then you know individual choice is the issue, not enforced medical procedures. You didn't answer the question regarding pregnant women who intend to carry to term being required to have a sonogram.
So then the law is flawed because criminals could just as easily get their hands on select firearms, ban or no ban. You've just admitted that the bill did nothing and thus there's no justification for it to be reinstated.
It hasn't happened yet is not absolute proof, just that it makes the probability of it being wrong quite small. By the way, if you are in the least bit intellectually honest, I challenge you to actually act on any of those doubts about the reality of existence and any other reality that we understand from all human experience. Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.
Actually, I find it near impossible to discuss the second amendment without gun control advocates bringing up the third argument. Weak? Yes. Rare? No.      In my opinion, all arguments in favor of gun control are weak.
Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a "link," whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!
actually some did talk about the complexity of life as well as irreducible complexity even though it may not be mentioned in the title
So? There are other articles and books that do. Is your link the ultimate authority on the cause of crime?
Far from showing any modern knowledge of blood circulation, this shows:1) if you take the blood out of an animal it will die. A simple fact all civilizations of the time would have known.2) God like for his followers kill living things. He is the God of blood.
Neener neener - is it time to go in from the playground yet?
No you can prevent the life of the unborn because they are not living but I don't think you should end the life of the born.
That's why I voted as I did as well. Ideally I'd prefer the "none required" policy.
The burden of a pregnancy is the woman's. It should be left up to her and her doctor to decide what is best for her.
But because your book of mythology tells you about a week of creation, you prefer that (because it requires less thought) to examining reality.
You could put the stranger out even if they had nowhere to go and it was freezing cold out.
Notice the double-standard here? The homosexual lobby accuses us of harassment, yet they are willing to provide names and addresses of people who oppose their agenda. I can't wait to see the backlash from this one.
Socialsim and Communism in the Soviet Union failed because the USSR spent its entire existence recovering from war. The country was bombed to hell by Germany twice, around the time of the world wars. The united states put unspeakable amounts of money into their war machine, which forced the Soviets to do the same. I, for one, would buy a gun If I knew my neighbor had six, and he wanted me dead.The CIA and American military carried out immoral operations in 60+ countries since 1945. The soviet KGB, as far as I know, has only been in Germany, korea, China, and Afgahnistan.
If we bankrupt the country, the war on terror won't be the reason. Wasteful domestic spending is the only reason we have trouble funding the war on terror. We need to get intellegent with domestic spending. We could start with the $7 billion EPA.
You do have a problem with this person defending himself or you would not be attacking him. Fear made him do this. The fear was created in him by the buglers.   You want unarmed passengers to attack armed terrorists on airplanes, but you have a problem with a home owner killing buglers.
And just how are the criminals and terroists to be kept from entering a school while armed? Airplanes, probably with some of the new technology, but schools, or bars, or post offices, or government buildings? Just a law that says it is illegal, surely is not going to work. emoticonXDonno
Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.
I know of at least 3 personally, including my brother. He fought for custody for years and it nearly bankrupted him. He was trying to get his kids away from an ex-wife that would go away with her boyfriend for weekends at a time and leave their 15 year old daughter in charge of threee younger siblings. 
Yes, but all concepts of right or wrong are subjective.
What I've been saying here, and after awhile - the guilt, depression, etc - will get buried, deeper & deeper - but no negative/damaging experiences leave people. They stay quietly in the background-computer base -until, as you said: Hopefully, the person "finds some way of forgiving themselves", right. But what about in the mean-time? - And we know, from research & quite a number of Healers, that rot (inside a person) is damaging... and often in very unsuspecting ways.Much better to life benevolently, in the first place.Annie
What does adoption have to do with being pro choice or life? I thought that the waiting list was years and years long to get a baby. (Not trying to argue, just don't understand)
Because there are still a lot of people in this country that support oppression and injustice toward gay people.
It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. "Macro" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different.
Origins of science, whether truly started by those of faith or not, is irrelevant. Whatever science was, it has become a body of knowledge, through application of reason.
Mach, your ability to make the wrong argument on the wrong post continues. I ask a question of this person, you reply not to them, but to me, and with ad hominem, and a 'just-so' statement.
Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation. 
I've always gone the Scylla and Charybdis route before instead.
Exactly. Moreover, in Emerson the discussion of the 2nd Am. is dicta (arguments not pertinent to the verdict) so it is not a binding precedent even for the courts in the same Circuit.A question for the "original intent" crowd:What did the Founding Fathers intend with the misplaced comma in the 2nd Amendment?
What this highlights is that the laws of the land are ignored and some people try to place the blame on the victims.
I don't think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do. The father is supplying his DNA when he engages in sexual relations. After than point he has in effect signed a blank check. It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime. Fathers to be shouldn't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check. I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years.
In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic "mutation" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained.
The counter arguments put forth by its critics do not defeat the Violinist arguments, at the very least. Whether one accepts the argument anyway is another story :P
I believe you are thinking of orders, not denominations. There is a big difference.   Strict and loony? Could you be a little more specific, because this statement sounds like it's coming out of complete ignorance.   You also seem to be making the assumption that all of the non-Catholic Christians are somehow very similar, which couldn't be further from the truth.
Well, there's also carbon dating... Didn't you post something about a decay curve? Are you now going to deny the accuracy of that?
We don't live on carbon dioxide. We live from the energy stored in carbon compounds when we break them down.
You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples.
No. We know that evolution happens. What would be a problem would be to find the processes that made evolution happen as such incredible rates. There isn't any evidence that it can happen that fast.
Because there is no evidence against the virgin birth and there is considerable evidence against Adam -- including the text of Genesis 1.
Little boy, you need to do a little study on Nazis. They specialized in death. Unlike pro-life people.
And yet, for most pro-choice folk on these forums, this question really is meaningless. For, even when it is assumed by these folk that the embryo has rights, they nevertheless argue that abortion is still acceptable. Even you believe this Shooter.
Well then quit trolling, and start debunking the BS by providing links to cases that were solved by having a gun registry in place.
From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo...w/26satel.htmlHmmm, Teddy Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, the Rockefeller foundations, millions of Americans, the State of Indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS.Interesting, yes?
You contradict yourself. If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis.
In older times man had more questions without answers than today. Some men believed if a God of fire because they did not understand what fire was. Because of their misunderstanding they invented an answer, the Fire God. Today we know exactly what fire is and we don't need to invoke some mythical explanation. Today's atheists know that there are many other questions we don't have answers for and it's OK to simply say we don't know instead of buying into the whole "let's-invent-some-god-to-explain-it" mentality....
Come on, people. You don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. There's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. And if no one else would have, I would have.
Why don't we do the same for straight marriages then?Why doesn't a straight couple that gets married in Colorado, and then moves to Virginia, have to get their divorce "remotely" from Virginia.Or maybe you should start thinking about what AUTHORITY Colorado has to grant a divorce to Virginian RESIDENTS.
Actually, the answer might depend more on the nature of the question, or the particular religious cult of the person being asked, etc. In questions of science, fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture.On the other hand, you are characterizing religion as insanity. I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science, then that is insane.
Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically. (and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal)
Exactly. It is their fault, but they can do what they choose. It is punishment and you know it, and it is not your job to make sure no "irresponsible" pregnant woman goes unpunished.
You do not have a right to drive. No one does. Driving is not a right. The state does not owe it to you to give you a license to drive. The activity of driving is a priveldge granted by the state, not a right.Rights are not regulated by government. You have them and no earthly authority can take it away from you. The state never gave me my rights, I already had them, nor do I have to ask for permission to exercise them.
I believe you, OTHERS pick and choose what you believe. What is sad is how many lose their faith when they find how much they have been mislead.
This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.
And evolution is exhausted. It can't do anything with origins, and recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life exhaust it even more.
Well he has further political aspirations..........The 9th circuit in Sodom (SF) is always making law instead of interpreting it........That is why they are over ruled so often.......
Well let's see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages, suddenly there was more support for a Federal Marriage Amendment than ever, Democrats lost more seats in Congress, the minority Democratic leader was defeated after years in office, a protestant presidential candidate carried the Catholic vote against a Catholic candidate, evangelicals in the country were energized, the pro-FMA candidate WON re-election even though his approval rating was 50%, and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it's up in the air again.The more you push you agenda through activist judges, the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment. At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election.
It can go both ways. We all doubt. It is what you do with it that matters.[QUOTE=gnojek]If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort?Is faith some innate human tendency?It could be seeing as how there is the "god spot" in the brain, but maybe the god spot wouldn't develop as fully in the child that was never exposed to religion or thoughts of the supernatural.QUOTE]Look around. Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air. It is obviously part of our psyche. Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith. Even on different sides of the planet.It's as natural as the sun rising.
Well, those who keep using that story can't see the real sins of those cities. They are so sure that it was rampent homosexuality which lead to their destruction. Even though we know that before the Angels were ever sent God had spelled out why he was going to destroy them. He sent the angels because they promiced to find even one righteous man. They failed in that because the angels were attacked for being foreigners. Noone who abuses this story is ever going to admit this fact. They can't see past the supposed homosexual issue.
Thats true. However, do we not have a state of reasonable compromise at the moment?
Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.
No nation is perfect, Rev. Not even the USA! A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail.You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK, the USA and Australia. There is injustice everywhere.
For a 13 year old girl that could greatly damage her body to have a pregnancy so young. She is just starting to grow and mature, and its not healthy, natural, or right to have a pregnancy at that age. She could cause alot of damage being that young.
But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).
Well if your claim is that you shouldn't push a gun owner's buttons and make them mad, then why are you arguing with me when that's what you're claiming is the wrong thing to do?
Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again.
They do offer a good insulating blanket which would keep the body of the reptile warm which in turn, would allow the reptile to remain active for a longer period of time. This means more time to hunt and reproduce carrying the mutation onwards.
It is clear that the profetallifers wish to make the pregnant woman a slave to her fetus.
Bad Religion or misapplied Religion has been in every century, country and culture.
The fact that some scientists totally dismiss god is proof of there ignorance of scientific method. There is growing evidence to support the existence of a supreme being, and a lot of scientists are ignorant of this fact, yet they accept theories from the quantum level wich are not proven beyond the proof of the existence of god. Mayabe your mind isnt as closed as others I have spoke with on this subject. I do believe in scientific method, but I also have faith that god is out there.
So you're actually claiming that it is a lie to say that the UK has a lower gun crime rate than the US? Even if the police were miscounting crimes it's still a huge and unjustified leap in logic to conclude from that that the UK does not have a lower gun crime rate.
But behind that are deeper, more fundamental issues about what homosexuality IS and the morality of it. To many people who view homoseuxality as immoral, your movement seems to be trying to write immorality into law.
State courts can rule based on state and/or federal law. In this case, the answer was found in the state constitution, so the judge did not need to pursue the issue further.Also, a state constitution can offer more protection that the federal one, as long as, in so doing, it does not contradict the federal constitution.
It is horribly oppressive of women, though, to oppose both abortion and contraceptives. That means that women will have no control over their pregnancies at all.
All of these examples are scientifically recognized as human life with a unique genetic code.
As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity.
That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful.
I don't know if you ever heard of the UK Poll Tax but I could have seen myself protesting by non-payment against such a grotesquely unfair system of taxation had I been of the age to do so.
Again, what evidence? anthropic principle doesn't have anything to do with creation. Puntucated Equlibrium anyone? How is symbiotic relations beteween plants and insects sign of creation?What are you talking about? A dog can't have a cat. That's retarded. What facts are you talking abot? 
Because in the case of glacial/interglacial variation, CO2 functions as a feedback from orbital forcing. Again, this is all very simple, basic stuff outlined in chapter 6 of the AR4.
Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts.
And that is why they are wrong. They don't understand science. Science is not the presentation of proof but explanations of the evidence that have been tested.
Either a gross misunderstanding or a gross misrepresentation of evolutionary theory.
so what about jesus' life is credible if the source is unreliable? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead? what did the authors get right? i mean, i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace. but you dont. so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did?it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true, otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have.
They have. Prey animals have their eyes to the sides of their heads which allows them to see in every direction, almost 360 degrees around. Predator animals have their both eyes facing forward.
Does any part of the theory of evolution give an accounting of how we transitioned from quadruped movements of the ape to biped? 
Does the sexual orientation of the would-be single parent even come up?
Yes, but our cells, are functional. It's cells are not yet functional beyond dividing.
Honest question Arch: where is the problem with a potential variance of 10 billion years? I know this question may appear ridiculous to you but could you take the question in the spirit it was meant?
And I'm going to correct you again. The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view. More than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations.
Given that I do not hold that opinion, I would challenge you show where I have stated such.
I think you have your image of an assault weapon slightly skewed. an assault weapon by its very name is a weapon designed to harm another human. this does not mean full auto it just means that it was never designed to be a target/hunting/self defense weapon.
"Ready to go", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures.Barbarian, regarding mutations:There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? .
Actually "I don't know" is quite a valid answer in science.However, again you slip into this false construct of a belief that all that can be known is in the scope of science; which you've also denied saying you believe in the past.[quote=Montalban]Is this a rational statement? If so, prove it rationally, by science. 
Oh? And what do you consider yourself when it comes to gun rights? Are you moderate or fanatical? Would you actually declare yourself a fanatic or would you like to be known as a moderate?   I don't think any organization who wants to be taken seriously will declare themselves fanatical about their cause because that would take away from their credibility.
Listen, I have forgotten more than you will ever learn about what is real and true in this world, so either back up your insults with facts or get lost because It is becoming painfully obvious that attempting to reason with you is an exercise in futility. kind of like trying to travel from point A to point B on a merry-go-round.
Well sigma, which is more painful??   Being burnt with salene for 30 minutes to an hour and if that doesnt work after the 3rd time, being born prematurally and laid on a table and starving to death.....   OR   A woman sticking a clothes hanger up and accidentally killing herself but intentionally killing the kid within her?   seems to me that people dont really care about how the baby feels. It has just as much feeling as the mother.
Today's students are tomorrow's scientists. They are unlikely to study something that, if they hear about it at all, they hear about it on a less serious level than they do the happenstance origins of atheist evolution. To reduce ID to other classes like literature or social sciences, etc. (where poetry, fiction, and prehistoric beliefs are the subject matter) is nothing more than a clever, dishonest attempt to belittle it.
Many natural disasters such as tornados, destructive flood, severe drought probably have something to do with global warming.I don't know which is first regarding these combinations. Maybe flood is caused due to global warming, maybe reverse.These phenomena are related each other, so it can't be seperated when we think about it.Maybe global warming itself is not such a big threat but many disadvantages resulting from this are threats to us.
And how did the Wise Creator come into existence? All that wisdom and creativity cannot come to existence accidentally or spontaneously...
I think you got it backwards Kelvin. You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.   And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow.
You state "the woman comes first". This seems to be your only "absolute". Why does the woman come first? Is it because she is fully developed? Is she more important than the child she is carrying?
How do we know anything for sure? We can't be certain of the Earth's age in billions of years, but we can use carbon dating to figure out it's older then 55,000 years, which refutes creationism.
Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing.       Why didn't YOU cite them?
But my relationship is between a man and woman. You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that. Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman.
No Peeling, it would be, "We proved it was possible to evolve as humans have, so why can only we do it?" Why hasn't one other creature on Earth ever evolved to our level of sophistication in the same alleged 4 billion years that we have had to attain our level of evolution? If evo is real, then it seems only right that it should touch all species equally and that all species that weren't forced into extinction, but survived and overcame the pressures they faced should have ended up in a similar evolved place that man has attained in 4 billion years.Unless of course that the science of evolution is a humanistic justification to explain our origins but has no basis in fact what so ever. And that is my claim and belief.
And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a "high powered rifle" despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics.
an image is not the original. a photo of you is not you, its an image of you. the image cannot be or replace the original, and isnt intended toregardless of how "perfect" the photocopier is, you cannot cash the "perfect" copy of the check. it may be a perfect replica, to the detail, but it is still only an image. the problem isnt the quality of the copying process, but the fact that the copy itself is just that, a copy, not the original
The biblical end has got to be near. This was a Doctor who spends all of his life saving people's lives.
Well either way he didn't answer the question. I saw the video. I saw and heard his responce. He can't squirm his way out of the fact that he didn't know the answer.    The internet site also quotes:
Besides the hundreds of cases in which such things are directly observed, I guess you're right.
Not once have I said he is perfect. But when people criticize things that I either know are false or I don't agree with, I will back him up. Just like people back up Kerry. I will remember that when you try to defend anyone.
No it's not. Perhaps because you don't understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with ID. ID is not science and has no evidence to support it.
well i was downplaying your argument because really, pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body. ITS NATURAL! OBESITY ISNT!
The laws of physics are short, descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way. Many times the "laws of physics" have been amended by further information, causing the law to be restated.Actually, I think he meant the way that we have observed the universe and all of nature to operate.
And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology.
But just try and remove them from those that think we do and you will have a war on your hands. It's too bad we didn't become more like Canada is respect to gun ownership. A lot more people would be alive today and others not sitting in prison for crimes they commited.
Is that not agnostic? You leave yourself open to change if evidence dictates it.   Sorry if this is just turning into word games.
Not in the concept of what God is like. Jesus, salvation, the afterlife are other topics. Believing that there is a supreme being is only one step.
The only 'duty' that any human being has with a parasite is to extract it as quickly as they can, if they chose to do so.
But I see two people involved here. Whether the women is better off or not is irrelevant to me. She has no right to kill the other just like you have no right to kill your neighbor. I'm not for allowing decisions on everything and to be against "choices" is not a bad thing considering every law restricts choices.
How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by "less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined. 
I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The "you believe in evolution" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that.
Oh, is THAT where you are getting your information? The Biotic Message? I read the book tens years ago and eventually sold it because it wasn't worth keeping. You do know that it is a book on biology written not by a biologist, but by an engineer. Right? Walter Jame ReMine is a mere engineer of some sort, and has no degree in biology. And biologists strongly argue against his claims. PS: I even had a few exchanges with ReMine when I was posting at ARN. I argued against him, even though I was an IDist at the time, because he was not being truthful.
For years I've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact. To date, no takers. Want to step up?
The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.
How is that a affect of deterrence? Deterrence works by preventing people through the fear of consequences. A dead man has no fears. Furman Vs. Georgia, where the supreme court specifically noted that there is not a single piece of conclusive evidence that the penalty is a effective deterrent.
So God already knows if a particular person will become an addict? That doesn't leave much free choice for that person, does it? If I go to a restaurant and God already knows I'm going to choose the poached salmon for my entree, then I don't have much choice in the matter, do I? Omniscience and free will are mutually exclusive. If God is omniscient, then we are indeed ultimately robots. Deluded with the perception of free will, but robots none the less.Unless of course, God is so omnipotent that he can know everything and still allow free choice. But then reason, logic, and thought become delusional. Sounds like a loose / loose situation to me.
To the extent that working toward social change on any moralistic issue is an 'imposition', sure. But I think one could say that about anything that has a social effect.
This is a very simple, easily answerable question. Most people, especially in America, have problems with people telling them what to do. Teenagers hate being under the authority of adults. Adults hate being under the authority of the government and enforcers of the law. Everyone in the world is under worldly authority, but to actually have a God who created you, which gives him the right to make commandments stating what is good for you and what is not, that makes most people really XXXXXX off. 
I've been posting at least a few times a week. That's a lot more than once a month. I pointed out that the US has higher levels of gun crime than most developed nations while you tried to focus on a few tragedies in response to someone questioning the claim that criminals will always get guns. I think it's obvious whose argument is more cherry picked. 
Yes, in my view, it would be morally correct since it has no brain and, in my definition, is not a person with rights. However, if she doesn't want to support the violinist in that future, she has the responsibility to disconnect from (and therefore kill) that brainless body before the brain gets transplanted. Otherwise, if she waits to disconnect until it is too late, she would be guilty of killing the violinist (a person).
Nothing "proves" evolution. However, there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that supports evolution.
Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of "creation science" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science.
Well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review. The source is listed at the bottom.
Because that the law one has to presume and of course the law applied to that specific case. As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.
Unfortunately Democrats have a credibility problem. Many Pro-gun Democrats have been elected, and America is giving them a chance, but apparently they do not believe Obama because of his past Anti-gun support and votes. However   Ms. Feinstein's comments about waiting for the correct timing to bring up gun control  did not help the creditability problem either. I guess only time will tell.
And he accomplished all this human carnage without a gun. This just proves that if it was possible to eliminate all projectile firing weapons from existing on earth, men would find a way to commit atrocities against his own kind just as he did before such weapons existed if murder was in his heart. Guns are not the issue, the corrupted heart/nature of humanity is.
I think I posted that awhile ago. Its huge BS. Thats like saying "Civil rights hurt blacks". Even though abortion may have some unwated side affects, its no where near the emotional and physical pain and suffering for the rest of your life than a forced pregnancy. Just goes to show that the pro-life movement is desperate.
Nothing. "T. Kennedy" is an alias of a known terrorist.
I know you're talking to Jessica, so I will only comment on this. It would be easier to make it rare if pro-life people weren't intent on making it illegal. Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.
If the fetus is human is not relevant? So if everyone says it is human then it still doesn't have a right to live then huh? Do you really support the killing of an innocent life for whatever reason? Do you really think placing one human over another is good (in this case women is more important then baby)?
Wow, I think this is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that the pro-choice movement is for the sake of the child. Sorry, you aren't even close. I don't know a pro-choicer period that would say it's for anything other than the sake of the woman.
You say you cannot see it from the gay perspective, then you speak from that perspective as a gay man. This is confusing. As a heterosexual, if you are one, would you give up those rights and let gays have the rights?
Well, their cash cow dried up and even Toby Hoover is going to have to get a new gig. No matter how many times these dire warnings were given they just never came to pass and over 2/3rds of the people are wise to them now and they have lost any credibility at all. Folks all over are now standing up demanding their rights and the left has expended both it's money and political and emotional capital. Stick a fork in them Lucy, they are done emoticonXHoho
And so on. Yes. a lie generated by creationist liars is what you use as source for what scientists are claimed to adhere to? Your dishonesty is actually rather startling. This is the worst attempt at dishonesty I have seen from lying creationists yet, and your gleeful introduction of that lie shows how truly and completely dishonest you are. Would you stop your lies. You are pathetic.
No more so than the Scalia/Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case.
You're obviously an Obama supporter, they're the only people who wouldn't be upset at his abusive tactics of threatening lawsuits against anyone that runs unfavorable ads against him, thus showing that he doesn't support the First Amendment.
So given that there are cases where both dies... we just have to give up the mother's right to live over a fetus (which will die)? What if the mother isn't physically ready to have a baby. In the case of a young female (I'm talking age of 9 and younger, cause there are cases of young kids having their periods) being raped, doesn't she a "baby" (and I say baby, because she is still at an age where a parent would consider her their youngin)... have the right to live? For me, if I knew my child was raped and is in no way ready for a child of her own, physically or mentally... I would rather her not risk her life to try and bring that fetus into the world.Abortion should be pro-choice.
I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yet
No it doesn't. That's why Darwin objected to the use of that phrase in reference to his theory. Those who don't bother to learn the theory tend to misunderstand. Fittness is not a reference to big and strong. It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.I'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.You've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong.
Could you please cite where you are getting this biological definition of evolution?
You only say that it won't make a change because you support the effects it will have.
382 - 405 are the dates I have, under Pope Damasus I.
Nice try. If America was an Ally to Germany during WWII, to this day you wouldn't forgive US Citizens no matter what excuse they have.
Well then there's grounds for a lawsuit. Find a group of veterans and get them to sue the VA, funded by the NRA, and take the whole organization to court on charges of violating federal standards.
Again, we never said that a human fetus was a different species.
I'm not against concealed carry in principle but open carry seems silly to me. I smell posers.
Then should not your challenge be re-worded to say "What might be the best..."Because at present we are not at a stage where by we know everything about 'pain' therefore in the current climate, rather than what might be known down the track, I think I have met the majority of your challenge. After-all, you are insisting now on what 'you can measure', and we can't measure all that there is about pain, at present.
I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people.
No its federal property and falls under AR190-11 and other applicable regulations.   If they live off post I believe so if they follow policy and regulations. If they live on post then the POWs must be stored in unit arms rooms and only drawn out with the commander's permission.
Socialism is a very broad category of political ideals, which particular form were you thinking of?And just so you know, Fascism is not a form of socialism in any way. Socialism does not have oppressive governments. The purpose of socialism is to remove the class differences in society, if there is a small group of bureaucrats enforcing their will on the workers then that's a class difference.
I agree, for the most part. Once you get to tanks and helicopters though? Too big, too easy a target for a tyrannical regime. Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters? I'm sure they could get them if they really wanted, but they're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers. Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines.
You offer no positive evidence towards Creationism nor did you deny that the idea of Creationism as scientific was destroyed long ago.
so since most abortions weren't rape, do you still support abortions for people who are raped? Just wondering.
None of the 'fishersci' links would take, but I did get a look at the fibre optic systems. Will try again later.
Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.
He was barred for presenting hard evidence against the Big Bang. Observable evidence. He was the head astronomer at Mt Carmel not just another astronomer. He was our best one.Being barred from the telescopes he was in charge of , being fired , and having to move to Germany is not what you consider suppression? I am not willing to discuss this with you anymore if you refuse to do it honestly. You can say anything.
Well do you mean Texas or Texans? Because Texas holds the record for execusions in the US. Not something I'd be proud of.
That wasn't my question. My question wasn't what you said, but what you believed. You sort of answered that. But the same people spouting off about the second ammendment being the reason for guns should also be for it defending your right to a nuclear bomb.
I have never disagreed that marriage is a special dependent class. My point is that it is a society-sanctioned special class.
I don't think people have a right to kills themselves (obviously not natural and obviously not legal right now). As for the other question, I wouldn't think a blatent disregard for the others health is morally ok.
I do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define ALL abortions as either right or wrong. In between, there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong. Why limit yourself to the extreme views? I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. After all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with. However, the question of people's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights. Really ... what other question is more relevant?
Oh, we don't have to - sorry, I wasn't clear enough there. What I'm trying to do is correct your misapprehensions concerning common descent. You said this:
The 7 day creation I am referring to, not merely the possibility of divine creation through the Big bang etc
Well, as usual the Creationist is trying to make an arguement against science using their moral viewpoint. Forget about all that pseudo science trying to discredit evolution and geochronology, all it comes down to is this: "My religion has the exact answers to questions about my origins, I do not like what science has to say on this subject".Its so much more succinct that way, I just wish they could be up front about it.
No. I never mentioned grades. You brought that one up. I'm saying that having guns on school campus isn't a good plan due to the high level of emotions in the area.
Yes Peeling; you say this with such assurance, yet what you can't explain with any assurance is why only one offshoot of the Primate genus evolved into what human beings are today. Why only us, when we all allegedly started in the same environment with the same ecosystems putting the same pressures on us. What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found. So your explanation that one species evolved while another stagnated or died out rings hollow with me. Especially since you can actually prove absolutely none of this. Can't you see that Peeling? None of this is provable.
Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. The reason I say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. Kinda just says that there are other people out there.
That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources "until the newborn dies" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.
But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.
You blame others for your failure to understand the basics.
Any form of legislation is a voting matter. That's the way our system works.
Lurch, I don't appreciate your condescending tone. If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions, you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin's Black Box.
Well, in the sense that we cannot actually detect the intelligent design Behe proposes, then it it OUTSIDE the limit of actual detection.
Right on! A real man supports those he loves, through thick and thin. He doesn't try and control the things he can't either.In the end, it's not a man's decision. It is not his body, therefore, he has no right to make the ultimate decision. He can only express his view. That's about it. (I'm pretty sure it's not any easier for her to decide). So cudos to those men.
So what, the thread isn't about her signature. If we started responding to threads by attacking people's signatures, we'd all be in serious trouble. Especially me emoticonXAngel
You JUST said they get health care in the hospital! Read your post, where's there NO healthcare. And it IS based on the ability to pay...you just want me to pay for someone else's and in the most inefficient way possible.
They need to keep their opinions to themselves and out of the law the effect gay peoples lives. I see nothing wrong with locking up those who incite hatred towards gay people just as we lock up people who shout fire in a crowded theatre.
I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.
Even though I am for gay marriage I do agree. Correlation is not causation.
I think it would be an exception as well.But if you see an indicator that might point to an "exception", I think the question should be asked.Consider the flip side of things. The question doesn't get asked.If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question.
Holy grail implies it is like a religion, which it is not. If evidence is found that overturns this theory, it will be discarded in favour of a better one.
wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions
Incorrect.   Evolution is not something that must be adhered to. It is a scientific theory. As such, if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn't account for, then the theory would be altered or scrapped. It's really quite simple.
Yes, you are missing something. How come age doesn't start at conception? How come when babies are born they aren't 9 months old instead of, well, seconds old.
As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?
Logically incorrect. One can as many red balls as one likes, and still only have one green one.
Apples and oranges. We're not demanding that they have abortions either.
But let me guess ... if they step down RIGHT after they find they will have to issue to gay couples, you'd be in favor of them being able to be sued for it, simply because the "discrimination" in such an event was toward gays? Right? At least if you are consistent with your stance elsewhere in regards to 'timing' ... emoticonXRolleyesAnyway, aside from that inconsistency with your position elsewhere, I agree that county officials should need to comply. After all, there are probably OTHER examples whereby county officials have to do things that they are religiously against, such as issue divorce papers. Or marry some drunk couple that they know aren't really being serious even though they're tying the knot ... If all county officials could just refuse to do their job because of their objections--for WHATEVER reasons--it would be a collosal mess.
Gun control maintains its racist roots even in this day and age. What other reason would there be for Form 4473 to ask applicants what their race is? What is the importance of knowing if somebody's white, black or mexican when they're buying a gun?
Actually the Alan Guttmacher Institute is quite reputible. They have their own web site. Check it out. Also, why would a site called "womens issuses" be in valid?
would that be legaly owned guns, or criminals who have guns (and also ues guns) for there crimes? most Gang members have guns, if they are killed in a drive by shooting, is the gun responsable, or would it be the illegal activitys?
To you, it may be an incorrect statement. But if it is, you have to tell me what it is you kill and take the life away from when you abort the zygote. Not knowing if it is being killed or not knowing someone wants to kill it makes no difference. Injustice is still practiced there, and not even some abortion doctors realize it.
Oh joy another drive by with absolutely no proof or evidence.
Everyone expects that. What they don't and shouldn't have to expect is that they will be specifically targeted and have to pay more, be penalised more, etc. than hetero couples such as yourself or me and my husband.
"Babies" are a stage reached after birth. If you are talking about abortions, then no babies are involved, anti-choice, histrionic revisionist linguistics none withstanding
None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about "information" or something.
You know what they mean, I know what they mean, but as someone involved in teaching evolution to high school kids I wish they'd avoid the implication of purposeful change and just refer to beak size changing in response to new selective pressure.As I said, I may just be being nit-picky. Language apart, this is another nice example of evolutionary change happening right before our eyes.
They are safer. The 300 gun deaths per year rate has dropped since then.Let's have a little reality intrude on the gun porn fantasies. Only 13% of Swiss homes ever had an Army-issue weapon in them, Militia service extending only from age 20 to age 30, and the ammunition was stored in a sealed pack, with severe punishments for the seal being broken.
Heller is about determining the answer to a long standing question on the nature of the Second Amendment, and how much gun control is legally allowed. Roe v. Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.I see absolutely no comparison between the two.
Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods.
But I think that is the point. What if you didn't agree with the germ theory of disease? Does that mean that it shouldn't be taught in health classes in our schools? Should it be replaced by the bad humors of night air theory? But not everyone agrees with that theory either.
if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will
We cannot prove the existence of God for, by definition, he dwells in a reality outside our own. Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace, nor can I disprove it, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists, by definition, in Hyperspace.I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe. A round square, a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously, you name it.
Well, it might help if you could propose a mechanism for such changing traits that would stand up as well as the current model of genetic inheritance.
I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.
To say nothing of the possible threats to people's safety, if not actual acts of violence.
So have I, since I know that evolution has and does take place. But I catch it from both sides because I don't believe the scientific explanation of the origins of life or the beginning of intelligent awareness.
Those abortions that are perpetrated as "birth control" should be outlawed.
Dealing with a designated nuisance species isn't the same thing as hunting. It's wildlife management.
So, I guess you didn't get the memo that this country was FOUNDED on Christian/Judaic beliefs. Remember: You do have rights; to an extent.
It may only be salvaging to you but to the parents involved it is body theft.Let me just ask you to step in our shoes for just 10 minutes imagine trawling around 100's of hospital labs and medical schools seeing all these poor little babies lined up in jars and i don't mean just a few there is up to 50 in each hospital and school imagine looking at those jars hoping that one of them is your child so you can at lastgive him the burial he/she deserves(a basic human right) yet at the same time praying that none of them are yours.Having done that can you still say that it is only salvage bearing in mind our children were only sent for post mortem and many of us have not seen them since?
End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.
You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons?How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others. Before you respons think about it. Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment? Lots of cannons? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly.
Semantics. God has mandated against homosexuality. My point is, people are prepared to admit that the creation story, and the story of noahs arc are metaphors. They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say "Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this..."But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?
Actually they do. Whether or not you think they should is another matter entirely. Did you not notice where the article came from? From a paper in India. I also found articles on the same subject from papers all over the country as well as in other countries such as Romania.   Save your snobbery for someone else.
Just some interesting information I learned when we went caving a couple years ago (a real cave, not one of the commercialized ones). Bats actually have better eyesite than humans, but even they can't see in pitch black. No eye can.
I think that the type of weapon does make a difference. A tyrant would be more dangerous to the world if he was armed with WMDs rather than knives.
Kronus said this was a win for science. He never mentioned that religion was discredited- never mentioned religion at all. Religion and science are utterly unrelated. Why would you make that connection?
Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that "informed" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution.
No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution.
But if you actually take time to read the study that is posted on that website it appears that the claims of the NSPOF are doubtful, inconsistent with other studies, and likely biased in favor of people answering that they had used a gun to defend themselves. 
Actually in high school I had a friend who used to be in placement. He was sixteen years old an he said he got the s*** beat out of him by an eight year old boy. "Street kids" get their XXX beat every day, pain is nothing new to them. It seems they're immune to it. It doesn't matter how hard you can hit, if you can't take a punch, then you can't call yourself street-worthy.
I don;t really know anything about british gun control in colonial india, and don't really see it's relevance, since colonial india is gone. I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army. This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule. The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).
Crime has dropped significantly in New York and Los Angeles in recent years. 
I'm glad you made the same correlation I did. ToE is a substitute for #### in this case.
Actually, everything the bible say's belies your "atheist answer". The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident. It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior, but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life.
So sorry, Anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. And now, using that excuse? What!   If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again. Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.   There are some who need to be put to death.   Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.   If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. I could very well be in prison myself.
And where exactly did you hear this? I find it hard to believe a governent that couldn't keep an affair or a low-level break-in under wraps could keep something like that secret................. Also if it is true and among alliance forces why do you blame solely the US?
Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief.
So we should just say "god did it", and give up?
NOt true,California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal.
What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. For both the 'braniac" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.
Because....expansion occurs after heat is added. How can a expansion occur with a prior cause? You're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time. Show me an example that does that.
That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress.
So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say "Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."
So do you want to argue my points or do you want to argue me? Which of my bullits are wrong? Which of them are right?
Accidents for one. Just last week a man who was drinking and cleaning his firearm accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Run a google search for "man shoots self" the amount of accidental shootings is rather disturbing yet funny. Most of these however are due to improper gun safety though.
Yes I disagree with that point. The navy, just like the police, can't possibly be everywhere that danger might raise its ugly head. Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them.
Any belief system is a religion loosely defined. I'd like to know how you think rights are afforded to born persons if not by a belief system or at the very least a belief in natural rights. Either way, that doesn't address the point I had. If I can't impose my beliefs on you then who you are to impose your belief of me not hurting chemist99a?
Obviously not. If the right to life trumps all other rights, then it follows that the mother's right to life and the child's right to life cancel each other out.       Mind you, if it's her choice then the pro-life movement endorses such heroism, right?
And were THIS the 17th century, I might understand that, but this is the 21st century. We don't "bleed" people to make them well; we don't have barbers performing surgery and we usually have a trained physician in the delivery room.
It's still not right for religious people to have to never speak their beliefs. It's a form of tyranny.
So, in summary, you aren't against the death penalty on principle. You just want it used judiciously? Same here. Where we'll differ is in the details of what's judiciously.
You can't...only admin can...and there's no need to be sorry.
Well we assume a right to your own body here. It is also important for you to justify why there should be a difference in human and person and then justify why doing so this time is different from when this was previously done in history.I guess I don't agree with the idea that you have no rights until you can prove you should have them...if this is the standard then we are all in trouble.
Read to the very end of the verse. "If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her."
Bellesiles claimed his data was destroyed in a flood. Lott claimed his data was destroyed in a computer crash. Some people have been calling John Lott "the Bellesiles of the Right." Read this article "The Bellesiles of the Right? Another firearms scholar whose dog ate his data."http://slate.msn.com/id/2078084/John Lott has already admitted to inventing a fan (Mary Rosh) to praise himself. That's intentionally trying to deceive people. http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp...&notFound=true
Every relationship does entail moral obligations in one way or another, but the argument is that there is no relationship that morally obligates one to share ones body. They are trying to generalize 'moral obligations' as if that justifies anything. There are things that cannot be morally obligated, no matter the relationship, so the argument tries to prove.
And the reasons have been discussed at length and most of us agree about the mother's life being endangered or possibly in cases of rape and incest.........Where we disagree with you is unecessary abortions...such as for birth control, a headache on just and inconveniencce........You think any abortion is alright...We don't.....
Should it be legalized? Only if every other country did itIs it harmful? Yes more so then moderate alcohol use and worse then smokingShould it be taxed once legalized? Yes.Should laws still apply to it, such as DUIs and the like? Yes.
Mayabe this is a miniscule amount of suffering compared to what awaits you on the flipside. Weather it be an eternity of Bliss or agony and suffering. Who really knows. Mayabe those who have this happen to them have it coming to them?
You have done a marvelous job knocking down strawmen of your own construction. Having offered a naive and superficial caricature of atheism, agnosticism, and theism, you then imagine a self-serving hierarchy that is, in a word, worthless - all in a silly effort to show yourself most humble. Ironic.
This was a comment on the physics book that has biographies of great physicists that were Bible believing christians. Right. Many believed in alchemy (they were wrong), harmful effects of night air (they were wrong), spontaneous growth of maggots from rotting meat (they were wrong), rats arising from grain (they were wrong), and the Bible (they were wrong). If it is important that Newton believed in the Bible, why isn't it as important that he believed in alchemy and did not believe in the divinity of Christ.There isn't any such thing as science from a Christian perspective. Either it is science, or it isn't.You claimed to have studied evolution. You didn't. Why would you tell us that you did?
Thank God. I too hope it doesn't keep going back and forth. While I live across the river in Parkville, Missouri, I used to live in Overland Park Kansas and went to school there. I think they are generally pretty good public schools, it's just the state school board that keeps effing everything up when they get some christonazis on board.
besides pain, there is a plethora of experiences that take place in a person's mind that cannot be yet detected by science. imagination, taste, dreams, art appreciation, etc. even though these things are real, they cannot be quantitatively described in physical terms, so they cannot be treated by science
No no; again, you don't get it. He's only struggling because of people like you who deny the obvious. Rather than listen to what Majerus says about Majerus's project, you're listening to Mr. Mistaken Coyne and the author of the the Science article, which doesn't say what you think it says.
Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you "view humanity with mental existance as important" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood. 
So, because they don't interpret the bible as you do, they believe that there are no deities? That is what you said...
Again???? Gun control laws by design are meant to kept inner city citizens (i.e. black) from owning guns... Liberal terms such as "saturday night special" all have racist undertones. Also since the majority of gun violence in the US is minority on minority... Who are these laws meant to target?
It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
It's truly amazing that even someone like KH can disprove evolution so quickly.
If Obama had his way, standing against the government would be the most patriotic thing someone could do.
That's a bit of a sidestep. Abortion is not genocide because abortion is not destruction of a certain group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc. There is no way to make a case for abortion being genocide without making capitol punishment qualify as genocide. Frankly, I think it's easier to do the latter (yet most pro-lifers are also pro-death penalty).If you want to make an argument, then make an argument. But don't call abortion genocide; that's just dumb.
Really, fetal persons are born. Science has demostrated that birth really occurs into the womb, not when one leaves it.
Theropods had hollow bones like birds. It was "developed to be lighter[sic]."
Actually, it hasn't. Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam's Razor. Further, DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences. It isn't that the DNA is different, what matters is the the sequence of the bases is different.
And what is the full quote? Was it talking about, lets say for example, tutles, where over 90 percent of them die before reaching adulthood?In many species, that is true. The 'rule of thumb' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood, the more offspring that species has.
If that is a human being, then is my kidney a human being too?
So ban guns? That is like curing the headache by cutting off the head. Why not make it a crime to sell a gun privately. Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database. I would certainly be willing to do this. As a responsible gun owner, I would hate to think that the firearm I was going to sell to someone might be going to a felon, or someone likely to use it to commit a crime. 
Just because we interpret the available evidence differently, for you to assume from that, that we believers know nothing about the universe we inhabit is arrogance to the max.
No. I will never allow "the people of the country" to tell me what is best for my my life or my health.To quote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice."I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."
we do......most fossils found are surface finds -- which means anything found on the ground probably contradicts uniformitarian principles because every fossil found laying on the ground probably -- according to ToE -- did not die at the same time. For example, many mammal bones are found on the surface -- yet so are dinosaur and other "ancient" bones from animals that supposedly lived millions of years beforehand. Of course evolutionists will come back and claim "erosion" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called "Hidden Archeology" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the "wrong" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false.
I can see what you are saying. It's pretty much true...being a Jewish homosexual, I know it first hand. But just for once, couldn't they pick on somebody else?It seems almost like a bully tactic for the Christian heterosexuals who are against same sex marriages to pick on someone who doesn't have a legal leg to stand on...that's sad.
Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read.
Nearly all the food humans eat today, even in the Western world is GM including maize, tomatoes, and soy, etc, etc. used as ingredients in products such some soymilk. Essentially everything is with the exception of "organic". However, as i noted above, I wouldn't make this argument because I think GM soy esecially is not very healthy for people snd GM foods tend to be more prone to bacterial infection which can make people sick. I haven't read from all sides, however.
I disagree. I've been in a loving, committed relationship for 25 years to the same person exclusively...how does this have a negative affect on you?
And last years stats say, 3rd July 2009   The most violent country in Europe: Britain is also worse than South Africa and U.S.
So there you have it: AMENDMENTS ARE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION.
Thanks, Clive, you're a good sport. Of course I can't agree with the idiot part. Rash, unwise, unknowledgeable, maybe, but not fools.
It's a flawed step in the right direction. I support it compared to nothing. I did not support it when they were considering CUs vs. full marriage. They took the politically expedient way out.Lest you leap to any unwarranted conclusions, my main objection is the blatent inequality inhererent in CUs.
The difference of 43 deaths a year is the 4th largest flucuation since 1990 - not what you call insignificant. Would this difference be made if more guns did equal more crime?
Well... someone hasn't been following the campaigns for the so-called "protection of marriage" amendments, federal or state.
I think you are on to something.The problem I see is that any proponent of a plan such as this will have toi take on both the health insurance lobby and the pharma lobby and their bottomless well of $$$ and propaganda.Here's hoping now that there's a new sheriff in town.
Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.
So would you care if abortion were outlawed. If so, what would be bad about allowing a view that places objective value in human life to be the basis for making law?
I didn't answer or you didn't understand? Actually I did answer. The knee joint I described is from a bipedal hominid - there is no question about it. The skull, even though I gave it very ape-like features, is from a biped. There are many examples of what I described.
That would be more likely than finding evidence for abiogenesis.
Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded. Hasn't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has. The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance. Here's some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com/andrys/noah
Or that they tend to be better prepared, or even less willing to accept help from others or get breakdown cover. That's the trouble with these kind of stats, the interpretations are pretty open to debate.
I didn't vote for a republican or a democrat in 2008 and in 2010 it doesn't matter because my rep is not challenged.
So do I, but my reasoning is highly speculative, even by my own standards.
Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example.
the fetus would be a real person...and it seems like....in order to make the iraq war/abortion connection....you would have to support the war!
Well if they're automatic weapons then they're obviously importing them illegally from outside the country and violating federal regulations. You've got even bigger problems than you think.
Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.   IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes.
Actually, Mega didn't make any claims. He just reposted an editorial.
Really? Do all your views depend on somebody else changing them for you?
I think our culture is going to play a big role in this as well. I think that is where the majority of this problem lies.
But your new language would be meaningless. The definition of a circle or a square does not vary from language to language. Mathematical definitions are not matters of opinion but quite precise descriptions so that all mathematicians will understand what is meant when the term is used. The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.
Well, I've personally measured the gravitational pull of a ball of lead about 5cm in diameter. Are you suggesting that angels push the planets around? That was the leading theory before Newton.
That's why the Second Amendment protects the private ownership of arms like the .50 BMG and other such powerful weapons.
This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do.
Well said.   With this religion, the gap is very wide between the "average guy" and "authority", because their clergy is more involved in politics than the clergy of Christianity, or the Creator himself. It fits with more Democrats being evolutionists, and more Democrats favoring bigger domestic government.
I would suggest you look at the faero island mouse then. That is a new species, and it is not man doing it, but rather nature itself.
Ah, you've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate. Sad, but predictable.       Obviously, I was discussing the entire article, which is making that argument. It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length.
Guess what, I'm pro-life as well, that is why I'm also pro-choice.
Hope you have fun carrying your pistol through the post office lobby!
Ok...many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU, South America, Asia, and so on....this hypocrisy annoys me.
Because it shows that Ockham was arguing against what Hi_Its_Me says the Razor is.
**   This is the best response you've got!?! What a loser!!
ICBM, but I believe the termites make up the largest land-based biomass on earth.
So now Wiesmann's barrier is the most important thing to the ToE? Somehow I doubt that biologists agree, but obviously creationists have more authority on the topic of evolution...
They were both created on the sixth day according to Genesis 1.
Doctors ARE schooled in nutrition, however inadequately, this doesn't mean they're going to recommend crackpot "raw food" dietary schemes to prevent destructive "lamarckian evolution" on the basis of a single flawed experiment on cats.
Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore.
I will agree science has disproven the literal reading of a number of different scriptures, such as the literal reading of Genesis (which was never meant to be literal to begin with, but that is a different matter).It also might explain why spiritiual beliefs exist for people.However, when it comes to this vaguly defined entity that alledgely created the universe, science has nothing to say about the existance of this alledged supernatural being.
Last time I checked, it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing. Not a debate about Creationism vs. "science" and "reality".
Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves.
Like most things theists that statement is based on ignorance.
I think we should not spend inordinate amount of resources on trying to determine who is homeless and if it his own fault. Anyway, whose business is it where someone lives?
What possible concern is any of that to you?    Some actually search for knowledge through debate. This is a debate forum if you recall. Don't play if you're not so inclined but to post warnings not to fall in this trap, c'mon.
Yes I know, a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute Behe's work. From your link;
Now you're being ridiculous. The big bang is not the evolution of the universe. The words "evolution of the universe" do not necessarily entail the big bang. For example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.But claiming that the "evolution of the universe" is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?By the way, I have always heard the creationist invention "GTE" referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity.
Well i know it wouldn't be sensible for anyone to call my child an it that is just disrespectfull to both your partener and child.
Because I don't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online. But for a quick summary: The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15% of caucasians, with 1% having the homogeneous version. These 1% are completely immune. The heterogeneous people possess some immunity.
Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage. I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.I think this is an important question, because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect.Until I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt.
For once I agree with you. Your wrong on your thoughts and views with evolution but your right in saying that abortion is wrong.
But isn't that the problem? This creationist decided that science should be limited to his religion. He's afraid of flying.
It's all in how you word the questions.You worded the questions with an obvious bias, they did not come across as an honest attempt to learn, but rather as a challenge.Word them properly, and I guarantee you that the people here will be most helpful.WaxyP.S. Your username has a large affect on how you are initially perceived.
I am so sorry to hear about what has happened to you. I hope you get away from this terrible man and surround yourself with people who love you.I must ask, though, why are you a Christian? You completely disagree with typical Christian sentiments on abortion, you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable, you feel like you did the right thing, so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day?
Yes California is following European socialism. Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes.
The article is saying that it was genetic changes. Changes in genes encoding certain transcription factors is what caused changes in the expression of other genes.
so if cells are controlled by their genes (and the environment), what would you predict would happen to the cell if its genes were removed?
I think that the bad guys will be happy if any gun control law goes into effect, because then there will be less chance of the victum having a weapon for their defense, and the crime rate will rise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well, first, those were Hebrews, not Christians. Secondly, the scripture doesn't say they raped them, it says "keep them for yourselves." That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention. Also, the Hebrews considered it impure to lie with non-Hebrew women or men, so if there was any sexual immorality going on it was very small. However, that DOESN'T mean it was justified or right.
Demographics plays a role, but it does not explain away the whole shift in the numbers.
While the current cannon was 'accepted' by the late second century, there were numerous other 'gospels' that existed by then, and were eliminated at the 4th century time frame. Most of those copies were destroyed, but some have been unearthed.
Gary Ridgway, the serial murderer of some 60 or more women, possibly more.
So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?
Actually, Galileo wasn't killed. He was sentenced to house arrest. And his sin was in declaring that the earth moved since the Bible states that the earth doesn't move.
That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do.
"Supposedly"? You ran from those threads. You are the one making assertions that you don't back up. You are the one unwilling (i.e. unable) to show that Arctic foxes can adapt to a Phoenix summer. You are the one who keeps ignoring (what I will henceforth refer to as) The Chihuahua Challenge. For somebody claiming to be so clearly right and so obviously vindicated by the evidence, you've done nothing to show it, and you've done everything to run from it.
Because, when each is in its natural habitat, they are reproductively isolated.
Oh, really? Does that mean that pesticides will be OK on marijuana plants? NO.
George Tiller shot to death at Wichita church | News Updates | Wichita Eagle
So you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate Brown and let him stop the bill? You suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide.
Regardless of the name change, the calendars are still keyed on the birth and death of Christ...and that will be so at least until the atheists are able to come up with another numbering system and force it on everyone else just to pacify their own baby mentalities.
Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time.
Only approximate and really depends upon what day you start counting, before or after menses.
oh, now we're getting somewhere. Explain more, please. Oh, and some evidence of incremental modifications would be nice too.
Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident.
well heck, if lifeforms cannot realistically be strung together by small, gradual, materialist increments (which they can't and there is no evidence for) then the only alternative is special creation.
I wish you guys would quit trying to "muddy the waters" by introducing facts that contradict my claims, innuendo, cliches and WAG. - signed X gazer
You mean to tell me it's a falsehood??   I don't believe it.
It is pretty bizzare. There are plenty of groups out there that will reach whatever "conclusion" you pay them to reach. Why he didn't cite one of them instead of an easily checkable source that says the opposite of what he says they do is beyond me.
Because Humphreys went out looking? How many should we allegedly find?
I'll address the later question. They may not "need" teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't "useful", they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case.
I have posted responses to Demon38's earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light.
And the comments section is usually where the real comedy lies.
But wouldn't it make it more likely that a gun dealer that was involved in gun trafficking would be audited and caught by the ATF? If there are less FFLs then the ATF has more time to monitor and inspect each gun dealer.
I think an open mind is the best thing to have when it comes to theories. I think there is some truth in everything.
Again, it's not the point. There are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory
and my wife is also a lot more likely to be overpowered if she has to close to with in a couple of feet of an invader, than if she can stay 15 or 20 feet back.
There's nothing to help, because what you said has no resemblance to reality.If someone is a junkie, they might also smoke pot, or if someone is a crackhead, they might also smoke pot, but the large majority of pot smokers DO NOT do heroin or smoke crack.
So 5,000 to 10,000 women dying from illegal abortions isn't high? Dude, that is nearly five times the number of women who were dying from abortions in the 1940s! That is VERY high!
not according the SCJ of Mass. This was part of the grounds of their ruling FOR marriage in Mass.
And that is meaningless babble. Evolution is a process that has been observed whether you like it or not. It is not a moral statement nor is it a statement of faith. It does not deal with government, laws or culture. Whining about it won't change it.
No, the question is why you let violent individuals remain free in public.
So what if the author isn't arguing against gun control? At last, there is indication that England has taken a step in the right direction and realized that taking all guns away from everybody isn't the answer to crime.
Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.
Because it will encourage teens to engage in riskier behavior. Abstinence until marriage is still the best way.
again, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. Please show me where it is anything than a belief. Evolution was always considered science. It used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. Until the "theory" of intelligent design does that, I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief.
"A story in some early editions of yesterday's Daily News incorrectly reported that gun-control advocate Sarah Brady may have skirted Delaware's gun laws when she bought a rifle for her adult son but did not declare who was going to own the weapon."The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm."In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'"The News regrets the error."CORRECTION
It is in the first place unclear to whom the "further harm" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different.
In 2000, the U.S. recorded close to 11,000 firearm homicides and more than 16,000 firearm suicides. The European Union -- an area with a population approximately 25% higher than that of the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,300 firearm homicides for the same year. In Japan, the number was 22.sinjin - The US firearm homicide rate is more than 180x that of Japan.
Again, true. But that doesn't take into account that there are two populations under consideration.

Actually, you have slipped into talking Bible here and seem to be refering to the miracle of Lazarus.
Oh, probably about as many as there are killed by bayonet lugs, pistol grips, heat shields, detachable magazines, and folding stocks.
So the stats come from John Lott.... Wasn't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause? http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may...on/oe-wiener31http://whoismaryrosh.com/....a bizarre individual who I don't think can be trusted.
you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing
Actually, the majority of my first post in this thread came from Robert H. Churchill's article who is an advocate of the individual rights interpretation.
If information came into being by chance, how can we know that anything is true? How do you know what is false and what is "true"? If we are just products of chance, your brain is also a product of chance. Therefore, the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. You can't even be sure you can reason properly (using your definition) because you can't trust your own logic.As for the second part, no, you've got it backward, rational belief is based on faith in a rational creator.

The difference, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done, has been given much thought and study. The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men, until, the fait accompli has been established. If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment.
ToE is a mechanistic theory -- it says life is like a machine. Machines aren't intelligent, they just do what they're made/programmed to do. Darwinists say lifeforms do what they do because of the way their particular genes program them. This is basic stuff.....yet you come along and say this isn't so. So which is it? Is life intelligent or not? If it is intelligent, what is illogical about believing life was designed intelligently by an intelligent designer? The intelligence had to come from somewhere. Where did the information in the DNA code come from?
Not if they give him the death penalty, then it's apeals till your ears bleed.
Not quite. To be more correct regarding government and guns, the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence.Our political philosophy is very clear on this:"that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it" - Declearation of IndependaceYou have the right to try and revolt with violence. You don't have the right to win a revolt.
But we weren't discussing either monkies or hell. One can only wonder at your thought processes that makes such irrelevant and disconnected thoughts pop up.
Actually, 2 viruses and a bacteria have been constructed by building the genome from nucleic acids.
If that's true, then Freedom of Speech is doomed. Harassment is subjective. Now I can claim that a book I don't like is harassing me, and it will be banned.
I'm still confused by this comment. Did you actually mean that? If you did, that is not Pro-choice but Pro-abortion. Women did not have a choice in whether their pregnancies were terminated or not which, having it, is the definition of the PC point of view. So no, they were NOT Pro-choice.
The memo is real, nobody has ever been able to disprove it. Handgun Control Inc. (the people who later became the Brady Campaign) have claimed that the memo is a hoax and that what was released has never been their official position. However them simply stating this, is no different than Obama making a statement on national news, and then several months later saying "I never said that" and trying to reverse his position.Until it can be proven beyond doubt as being untrue and simple propaganda, the memo is real and explains in detail exactly what the gun control groups are after.
Not all evolution takes place over billions of years. There has been speciation that we have actually seen occuring within a few years at a time. "bacteria, birds etcs."Natural selection occures frequently. You can "observe" evolution through the fossile record, DNA, morphology etcs.Evolution has made predictions, these predictions have come true, ergo, it's good.
Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.Barbarian observes:It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.
Then for you, you made the right decision at the time. I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child.
 I know a bit about this myself.  However the difference is that I was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute. An Armed person truly cannot be bullied! The old saying is. God created man and Samuel Colt made them equal! Old, disabled, female and all, are on an equal footing with these vicious predators!
You have any examples of that? Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is.
What we have here is simply a perspective problem, which is the problem with most debates. I see the Bible as sound, and every "error" in the Bible I have researched (I have admittedly not researched them all) have been refuted.
I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them).
Actually, no. If it had not been for the gay couples and the organizations who helped them fight for equality it wouldn't be an issue now, but it would still be an issue.
So God gets to do these terrible things, but He gets a free pass because He's God?Kinda funny what happens when you show Archie that the Bible doesn't even support his beliefs, isn't it guys?I still like the fact that the Bible says not to count children under one month of age as persons, yet here Archie expects us to count a zygote as "a human life."
Well, thank you for this thread Santafeur. I must say though that I peruse various threads just to read stuff. The C vs. E topic does not strike a nerve with me. In fact, I also wonder what it is about the human mind that makes people so desperate to want to know how we came about. What difference does it make? We are here now. Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?
This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.
(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?
From your own link it is very clear the NRA DID NOT say that or publish that. Your clearly very wrong.
And I would agree with you as long as all marriages for all couples were called civil unions and there is no two tiered system.
And for good reason. Electrical engineers in general have a pretty poor track record when discussing issues that have nothing to do with... electrical engineering. Examples: Walter ReMine, Fred Williams, etc.
You still haven't learned what Google is have you Yankee Fan?HowStuffWorks "Artificial Life"Artificial Life Likely in 3 to 10 Years - Science - redOrbitAnd relying entirely on insults is not a good way of gaining credibility. It didn't work on Livewire, it won't work here. 
It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.
Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing.
Not the way I see it from my experiences. I let the readers decide on their own. 
No one said he invented guns!A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[1] To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[1][2]
Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.
Schumer is a bonafide idiot, as are many in the Senate. He failingly tried to draw Alito into exposing how he would rule on abortion if presented a case. Alito is far too intelligent to be logically trapped by a buffoon such as Shumer.It is also plain to see he interrupts when he supposes the response will indeed make sense against his flailings.
And as their populations grew over thousands of years, civilizations seperate out and independent nations form, laws are set up, and some prosper while others wallow in poverty, how long do you think it will take until people begin to kill each other on your peaceful planets? Nice dream, but real life does not work like that.
Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars.
Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.
If you paid attention the BATFE said so.       Yes but some people don't want to close the borders. They prefer no border controls.
But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins. 
That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench.
I don't agree with this debate. If preventing the Devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by God then why is it that God did prevent the Devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated? They are both essentially taking the Devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good. God seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other. Why would that be?
This is why arguments like "well, our population is out of control" never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay. I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments... Pro-Lifers have a priority list, and Life makes it to the top. For Pro-Lifers, it's a little like saying "Well, Big Macs taste good, so you should never, ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good!" I mean, sure, burgers taste good, but filet mignon is so much better.
But the military is pretty much all a volunteer thing. It's not a hiring process--employer/employee thing. That arrangement lends itself more to the soldier not volunteering for service in the first place.
Absolutely true!I discovered that with my fluoride research...For whatever reason, most people take another's word for what the truth actually is instead of searching for it themselves.If the lie is an easier pill to swallow than the truth pill, they'll take the lie. emoticonXFrazzled
And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?
Sounds like the Brady Law has stopped a lot of criminals from obtaining handguns.
Finally someone answered the question. Thanks. I thought it might be the government.Does your government attempt to do this?What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?
Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.
As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to "purpose." And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase "survival of the fittest" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time "survival of the fittest" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory.
Actually, it's true. One Darwin's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection.
You weren't referring to your home in your little story of helplessness.
No, there really aren't. As for Robertson, why do you think I said he was right (as in global warming is happening and we are largely responsible) by sheer luck?
your probably referring to the mexican basin crater. mass extinction doesn't prove evolution. the flood as described in the Bible is an example of mass extinction. besides, in order for the asteroid theory to work, the asteroid would have to create an almost global tidal wave that would effectively kill the animals by drowning. also similiar to the effects of the flood.
Well, I personally agree that I 'spanked' marc9000 (http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6348). But we'll have to leave it to the judges to make the formal decision.
The anti-abortionists claim a load of **** on many issues. I don't listen to them. To put the "life" of an unfertilized egg above that of a person is grotesquely sick IMO. I support any such stem cell research wholeheartedly.
You forgot to fully quote John 8:18. here is the rest: and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me. He isn't bearing witness to Himself here. Two witnesses are, one of which is Himself, which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing. 
Well said. Most Americans favor more gun control, but unfortunately this majority of Americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue. This is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control. There probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but I'm not sure how much this will change things.
It's not about how she treated cops. It's about how cops treated her as an American citizen with rights.
What does being a priest have to do with anything? It wouldn't matter if he were a Satan worshipper.
I'm not claiming any omnipotent deciever. I'm not sure where you derive 'probability' from, or how you can have any degree of certainty over your past experiences or those of other consciousnesses.And in any case, saying 'it hasn't happened yet' is hardly logical proof.
Forgive me if this seems picky, but I just want to try and fully understand this argument. I should say that I don't necessarily agree with it, and would like to respond as to why. I just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that I can make a sound response.As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.... Where does this right originate from, i.e., is it from the US Constitution via the 14th amendment etc?
So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?
He didn't! I hope you reported that to the admin
Don't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in. I'm not that easily fooled.
Form 4473, question 11a reads as follows:11.a. Are you the actual buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him. By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.
But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.
So it's the blog's fault that Miller sided with the creationists. Right-o, marc. (I suspect you haven't even read the blog entry in question; I'd be surprised if you've read more than a paragraph of PZ's blog.. ever.)
That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed.
And if they are governed and regulated people can be victimized by the system. In fact, the regulation might be the very thing victimizing people. Again, it isn't the system but the people who are in society that make a morality.
Now, now ZSU, we learned from comrade star gazer that GW created the Continental Army. I am sure these gentlemen have some equally illogical and inaccurate 'facts' to scatter around the barnyard emoticonXHoho
you should be allowed to buy as many as you want to
Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events.
No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance.
So they had guns that could shoot down planes even before they had planes?   Their primitive muskets were that powerful? I am not that easy to fool!
You did when you talked about someone loving objects, or a mokey, etc.
A lot of work has been done on that topic. I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book, but it is definitely worth the read.
Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation. 
So any long publication must be due to a panic attack? It takes a few minutes to read those posts, but it takes an hour and a half to watch Expelled; does that mean that IDers are having the mother of all panic attacks?Your logic can't even be described as "tortured," marc, because it's completely nonexistent.
That's right. It merely has the capacity to make errors which sometimes slightly improves function in a particular environment. And those tend to accumulate over time.
Exactly. If you are a child rapist and someone pops you in the head than you should go to jail for murder. Sorry, two wrongs don't make a right.
So what's the deal when GWB "gives" $3,000 but the insurance premiums cost $6,000, the family can't make up the difference and the $3,000 goes unspent. All we've accomplished is to transfer $ out of the U.S. Treasury. You think it's a good idea to just give money away and not get anything for it? You're thinking of the Clinton years when there was a surplus.
Might be something to be said for that. Are there any studies that show possible causes of suicide?
Not at all. The issue is receiving the marriage benefits. If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?
Umm...thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do.
Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis. For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species. For ground- or tree-dwelling terrestrial animals, it would be of marginal or zero benefit, given the 'noise' in their immediate surroundings.
this is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic
But does anyone actually need a marriage to do this? No.   Are there any laws stating one must be married before giving birth? No.
Not realy they are still being manufactured for civilian use and are legal in most states even in states where machine guns are not allowed. You would be actualy supprised at how available they are. You sign your life away and are no longer a name less face to the feds but you may be able to own one in your state. All thats needed is to get your chief law enforcment officer to sign your fourm 4, pay $200 to BATFE, pass an FBI back ground chk and wait appx. 2 mo's and you have one.
Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them :)Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.
just cause you dont buy it doesnt mean it is not true. that life is sacred does provide a (if not the only) compelling altruistic basis for and responsibility to social justice whether it is actually walked out or not. I think that the fact that it is not really walked out in america proves that the majority of americans are not pro life (including a majority of those who actually claim to be pro life). This doesnt negate the truth though.
The other articles on her website are also well worth reading: Musings on Christianity, Homosexuality & the Bible
Depends on which cell you mean. Mammalian red blood cells, for example, have had their entire nuclei and mitochondria removed. Not so much as a smidgeon of DNA.
addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails
Man, these guys can't even get into the science before they're outright lying...
Prove your assertion that he has called himself a conservative Christian rather than a conservative Republican OP. Support your clai if you can or stop trying to lump everyone on the right together.
Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848.
Define "many". What you really mean one is too much. Even when the one is used soles for personal defense. Besides your in Austraila, no one cares what you think.
And the follow-on that Archie throws out there demonstrates his ignorance on the subject.Such laws DO NOT just protect homosexuals.They protect EVERYBODY from being fired just cause they are gay OR straight (or bisexual or nonsexual).It protects the straights just as much as it protects the gays.It has nothing to do with "better than" or "superior".If people like Archie understood legislation like ENDA, they wouldn't try to make such an absurd allegation! emoticonXEmbarrassed
You have this habit of making sweeping claims with little to no substantiation.And even if we were to completely ignore LeVay altogether, there is MOUNDS of other evidence showing a genetic cause.Like I keep pointing out, but nobody on your side of the fence seems to realize, NARTH's OWN CITED REFERENCES say there is a genetic cause!
Could it be that the Supreme Court does not view the right protected by the Second Amendment as being fundamental? This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.
Well, if you breed them, you could get taller monkeys with less hair (and other humanlike characteristics). Even so, it would take a long time.
Well, the 40Ar/39Ar method was used to say that it was 65 mya.This same method was used to date volcanic rock from the Mt. Vesuvius eruption to within 7 years. But the KT boundary was dated using several radiometric methods that all agree to within a couple of million years.Here is where I got that info:http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rnc...12_30_1899.aspLook at table 2.
I gotta admit, I got a real chuckle out of this one. :pWaxy
But not all "designs" are manufactured. Take the repetitive ridges of sand on a beach. They are created by the motion of the water. Shall I remind you of the humorous story about the "image of Jesus" that attracted much attention, yet turned out to be a coincidence of shadows? This is why I insist upon your defining the terms you're using.
You are a known anti-gun supporter, should we really be surprised at your presidential choice. Funny thing is, you are going to get screwed just like the rest of us if Obama wins. He might try to take our guns away, but your rights that are important to you wont be very far behind.
So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?
This is a pretty loose definition.It's like saying you have faith that Jesus will come again because you personally witnessed his ressurection.But you didn't, you have faith because you believe this with absolutely no material evidence or logic to back it up.
Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.
Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that "UK will be Islamic", "Sharia Law for UK" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly "taking over" )."muslims are taking over the world" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!
And he has still yet to provide one. If more gun-control means more lives saved then more gun-control means more self preservation.
And thats factually (and logically incorrect). There are many alternatives virtually an infinitude of them in fact.
And I don't expect you to. The reason you won't go into how all men were created equal during reconstruction is because you cannot prove that all men are not created equal.
When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified.
why the comparison of gun owners yo violent killers and serial rapists? What law have I broken? Since we are doing comparisons your anti-freedom agenda is very similar to the bazi gun control laws of the 1930s, it is like the jim crow laws of the US. Your agenda is one of racism. This is insulting, ignorant, and shows your true colors as an enemy of freedom.
No it didn't, there's no suggestions for how to enforce background checks to stomp out straw purchases. Stop offering non-solutions.
You can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. There are very many forms of evidence.
I think you fail to take into account that for most opposers of abortion, they genuinely feel they are trying to save lives by their opposition. In many cases it's not a matter of trying control sexual prermissiveness in society but preventing lives from being killed. Disagree or not, you can't separate the anti-abortion message from the fact that it holds to the view that abortion is a form of murder.
Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.
Please off one scientific piece of evidence in support of biblical creation.
I responded to your posts on the thread of "Lets discuss the actual..." I suggest we continue that discussion there.
This is exactly what I said in a pm to her. I also suggested that she talk to women who have had abortions, who have not, who have had adoptions, and who have been adopted. I wish there was some kind of "place" you could go to automatically get this kind of dialogue. Not internet sites, but face to face stuff.Want to start a counseling center? :)
But there is evidence that we do evolve. I'll give you an example. In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry.
The meticulously preserved, unchanging 66 Books of the Bible aren't compelling?
And why would I be anti Christianity when I am Christian?   Oh and by the way to who ever it was who said I don't believe in Jesus, or something to that extent, I never said anything to that extent, you just made up what you wanted and got mad about it. I believe in the teachings of Jesus. Yes I'm betting your asking me how I know about his teachings if I have never read the bible, My mom is someone who has re-read the bible like 6 or 7 times. So she's told me all about it, and what its supposed to teach us.
Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made "morals and ethics" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men.
Because to not view it as sacred presents a greater potential for harm. People sometimes to take a disposable view of things that they consider unimportant. To view humanity as sacred helps protect humanity.
I'm not familiar with the book, so can't comment upon it first hand. However http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/ appears to have a detailed critique of the book and may be of interest to you too. As I say I haven't read the original so cannot judge the quality of the link I'm supplying, so apologies in advance if it grossly misrepresents Mr Well's case.
Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.
Proof? All I can think to say is that a mind is a terrible thing to waste.
Actually, I reported the real results of a study. Regular church attendees are twice as likely to vote Republican...etc., the conclusion was, however, meant to be a joke. Most got it, you didn't. emoticonXRolleyes
But still, if you think there are rights in the bill of rights that is wrong, that should not be granted or guaranteed, it would be a viable option to vote for removing them.What debate are you trying to end here? The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?
Honestly I'm not sure if it was ever said in the Bible, but I sure have heard a lot of the Bible thumpers saying free will is a gift from God.
Because the modern application of gun control is to target everyone. But that doesn't change the fact that gun control began as a purely racist concept.
Well of course everybody is entitled. But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color, using the "black codes" enacted after the Civil War. If it weren't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution, minorities would still be out in the cold.The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment.
You realise I'm talking about if the burglar is running away, not the householder, right? Looking at it again I realise I may not have phrased it clearly enough. I'm saying that some of those "violent" crimes may simply have been burglars pegging it when disturbed.
And many of those countries are having problems with it. Furthermore, we aren't even proposing what other countries have.
Simply pointing out that swords cut in both directions.   Be that as it may, no one has refuted that there are more cases of Concealed Carry Permit holders who have gone off and assaulted people than there have been school shootings.   Care to try? Omegaman tried, failed, and went silent on the topic.
Well, I forgot to add one thing: a legal notice to the gov't about such behavior.
Well before there was a law someone came up with a difference, I didn't ask if they end result was the same, I asked if there was a difference in the two. Maybe a moral difference or something.
Give it a rest... what is evident here is more coffeehouse vasilation on your part... no foam.
It is ALL repeated time after time, and time again then again. But you are correct. Here is one of the links to those studies. emoticonXSmilie http://www.4forums.com/political/gun...tml#post354115But what do we do about this? http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcon...dennis_culhane Which is a study of criminals shooting criminals but it is hoped that people will think it is about Law Abiding Concealed Carry. This is NOT representative of Law-abiding Concealed Carry or legal gun ownership in any way. And we have this.Guns and Death - Firearms Research - Harvard Injury Control Research Center - Harvard School of Public HealthSo lets look at the actual crime figures to see if any of this holds water.  According to this 1999 article  there were 250 million guns in circulation in 1999.   Total NICS Background Checks November 30, 1998 - June 30, 2009 
It's all very interesting, but you left out a critical piece of information. You deliberately omitted the fact that most of the black victims were killed by fellow blacks. These weren't murders carried out by racist white guys, they're the examples of black on black violence.
Problem is, you think requiring a woman not to kill someone is "treating them as breeding animals". Kind of an odd thought.
I have heard that the USA spends around 40% (total) more on health care than Canada does. That would be impressive if it weren't for one fact. The USA has 900% of our population. It is your administration costs what are getting you the most. We only spend around 11% on administration while the USA spends around 25% of their health care dollars. We have a cap on how much a doctor can be sued for as well. Yes, our system isn't perfect, but it still works.Nearly 50 million Americans don't have health care at all, that is around 18% of your total population. This is quite shameful. As I've stated, the USA is the only Nation in the Industrialize world to not have universal health care.
Are you saying that given enough time you can come with answers? That's a statement of faith.
Brinks plays on people's fears to sell security systems that don't even work. Insurance companies play on people's fears to sell their policies.

I looked it up and apparently there is a synthetic form of THC on the market, (generically known as Dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol). But it is only allowed under restricted prescription (it's a Schedule II controlled substance, the same as morphine or cocaine) and is far less effective than plant-derived THC.
Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.
Actually, society hasn't said this. 5 judges, in very recent times, have. I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old. I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the "18 and over execution rule" in the eighth amendment.
Right. They can never show how the belief in their deity is not a textbook case of the special pleading fallacy. (Pretty funny after all the hubbub earlier about double standards...)
Because Africa isn't one big homogeneous ecosystem. There are jungles, plains, deserts, swamps. Himps living in the jungle weren't in competition with himps that started migrating out onto the plains. Their food sources are different, their territories are different. The more suited to plains-dwelling we became, the less attractive a prospect it was to return to the jungle. Pretty straightforward, really.
I wouls also add that humans have been able to make CHIHUAHUAs and Irish wolf hounds from wolves.
********. Utter fraking ****. Scientists have already accumulated mounds of evidence which suggest the common ancestor. You choose to ignore it as do most scientifically ignorant christians.
Yeah, it does have risk unlike the embryonic stem cells, but I think that if it comes out the way they hope, it will eventually lead to more embryonic uses as well when people realize that this can have risks. I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists. And yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about, claiming it is immoral (maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonXRolleyes ), but it will likely not have as many objections.
No contradiction; the Permian extinction was the most severe in history and noted as such in the page linked.
Of course not. That battle has already been lost. Creationism is religion and it cannot be taught in a science class, even when it is called "creation science" and the data is distorted and mininterpreted. The most recent attempt by creationists in Kansas on the State Board (and yes, they were YECs) was to eliminate all requirements to teach evolution, and all references to an old earth from all curriculum standards.
I believe in a strict interpretation of the Constitution, this makes me neither a liberal or conservative. The SN was inspired by VOR who kept signing his posts with quotes from Karl Marx.
Agreed that they are still the same species, much like the "13 species" of Darwin's Finches, and I have no problem with evolution in that respect. I can even see the plausibility of different subspecies evolving eventually into different species if they are geographically separated for a sufficiently long time. But I still don't see where evolution, in that sense of the term, can account for dozens of species of monkeys occupying the same patch of rainforest, or dozens of species of gazelles occupying the same patch of grassland.
The reported killings in European countries have rivaled the levels of Columbine. Quite a feat for a country with strict gun control laws. How can even a rare and isolated incident in a country with draconian gun control, meet or exceed something that's supposedly relatively common in America?
And as such, the term as you use it is utterly meaningless as it could be applied to any cell or sell remnant of human origin.
A master baiter like you should present your thesis to be taken seriously, you haven't and you aren't. 
'Self-defense' never enters into it, imo. Unwillingness to share ones body is not necessarily self-defense, so this does not apply.
You should have said that. I might have agreed with you.
Wrong and no one has ever called bone marrow an inner sanctum and I don't know what a baby's tabernacle might be.
Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by "higher" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved.
AGREED!!!!That has to be BY FAR the best series I've ever read!Also, Asimov's Foundation triligoy is good. And again, the classics:Fahrenheit 4511984Catcher in the Rye...and all those other depressing books...
And some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because "we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact.
But the fact remains that guns are, by design, weapons.
very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause
Gun writer Jeff Snider point out. Obama: No AWB for Now?
You misunderstand me I believe they should all be locked up. Anyone who preaches against gay people freely living their lives as equal citizens with all the rights and responsibilites should be locked up in the darkest dungeon. There can be no compromise on this issue peoples lives are at stake.
To force women to have babys that they dont even want is even more "preposterous".
I think hip hop and the arts are reflections of society. It is good to bring these issues to light, if only so that those who wouldn't normally be aware of them are enlightened.
What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?
You are the only one defending them now...the funny part it, planned parenthood had the stats as reasons why abortion should be legal (or is legal). But wait! As we established the number of people that died from abortions went down to under a thousand so this reason is still not accurate and is still misleading. Anymore ideas?
Of course everyone has some basis for their views. Not even denying that. However there are ways that using that "basis" most certainly is an imposition and the gay rights battle is a prime example. There are many, many, many people who have done work to stop/block gay marriage and other gay rights when they, themselves, are not gay. That is not merely passing judgement - that is imposition. All I am asking here is that Archie, you, JP, etc. own that.
No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time.
Almost?   Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.
You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape? Or a pregnancy that is going to put the life of the mother at risk?And to push the line a bit further, what about failed contraception, where the 'morning after' pill is taken? Does that count as abortion as it happens after conception?Smiley
No, you are mistaken. Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time. The age of the Universe is irrelevent.
Religious faith, by definition, is a "jump in the dark" and there is really little(if any) common intellectual ground on which Creationism and ScientificMaterialism can meet. In principle, given adequate evidence etc., there isnothing in the material world that cannot be explained by Science. Butsomeone who has, so to speak, already jumped into the dark cannot see this.The most interesting questions that a supernatural account of human life can raise are concerned with the evolution of law, morality, social conventions,aesthetic sensibility and such like.
But I think that Gods originally came about to explain why a large yellow thing goes up and down everyday. To a caveman the most logical explanation is there is a God. Now we know better. Just because there are still things we can't explain does not mean they must be from God.
Like blacks once were? Wasn't that the main thrust of the 14th amendment and incorporation? Given incorporation, imagine the suits those acts of discrimination would bring emoticonXGood 
Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?
Apparently this is a petition opposing the pending resolution before the Illinois lawmakers that will deprive the rights given in the Constitutions. It is to encourage the lawmakers to vote against it. The lawmakers have not yet agreed to vote it down. Knowing the State of Illinois, I am predicting they will pay no attention to the commoners.   The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time.
Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.
So you've gone from evolution and ID to cosmology. You have a real problem with maintaining established realms. ID addresses evolutionary theory, not abiogenesis, and not cosmology.
Being new isn't a problem. Nor is uncertainty about a position. The way to learn is to ask questions in appropriate places. However, a problem with message boards is that, without experience, it may be difficult to tell who is speaking from knowledge and who is speaking from ignorance or faith.
There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.
The whole "change the definition of marriage" is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots. They don't seem to realize that words can have several meanings.
So? In your religion's view, everyone sins. Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours.
This also applies to tapeworms. I fail to see how it is therefore relevent to any debate on abortion.
Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
The interesting thing about the 'quality of life ethic' is that, in a pro-choice framework, it means that we can't degrade anyone's quality of life without their permission. So far from entailing a cull of the elderly, the infirm, the handicapped, and the ugly, the quality of life ethic entails that we cannot kill them off. Each person is entitled to the quality of life that they desire where what they desire does not infringe on other's quality of life. 
So the initial murder wasn't enough to show "that they are willing to commit acts of violence"? This makes absolutely no sense.
The anti-abortionists claim that would be killing a human life to save one.
No it doesn't, as abortion WAS a legal option in this case.   This was not a legality issue, but an education issue.
All of the points above should be considered if you want to produce a solid argument that a series of events actually occured in the past. If you wish others to take this seriously please produce some relevant evidence from a source that held to a higher level of credibility. By your standards I should make a thread based on the National Enquirer or Star about Kerry's life as a male gigolo or golddigger.
If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it.
And we all know that is what it will become. I'm willing to bet money that Marc is going to argue that abiogenesis is a part of evolution as well as the big bang. There's a clear reason why he won't accept the definitions before the debate starts.
The problem here is that Christians (such as I am) consider the Bible to be Proof.
I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm asking if you'd think differently in that case, and you're not answering.
Clinton gave access to b/c which is known to prevent pregnancies. Bush has reduced access to b/c (including e/c). A primary reason for aborting is money - Americans have been less well off under Bush.
You/he could just have said 'slippery slope' in the first place; that argument is an old one, which I though was dealt with a long time ago. You can't disapprove of A on the grounds that it might lead to B - firstly because you have little to no evidence that it will, secondly because A is not necessary for B to happen and thirdly because that difference between A and B is all the argument you need to prevent B but be in favour of A. You can approve of punishing criminals but be against the death sentance.
First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition.
These aren't the only two options available. The many philosophical views of the material world or ethics don't mean these two things don't exist.
Yet it is the only source I've seen that counted the incedents in which a gun was used in self-defence, but nobody was injured. I could assume that all of your sources and Ians only count occasions where one was injured. According to the source, they'd 91.7% of all times where a gun was used in self-defence.
He's pointing out that the situation is about the mother and the baby, and that the baby's right to life ends exactly where the woman's right to personal autonomy begins. That's the interesting thing about rights-based ethics, that the rights of any individual are limited precisely by the rights of all other individuals.
I think that scientists don't work with religion and religion has no place in science class.
When the criminal has greater civil protections than his victim, and this is viewed as being civilized, a society is doomed.
Well let's put it this way. I really like playing baseball. So I put in a law that says everyone has to play baseball unless they're in a position where it will threaten their life. Since it's such a wonderful thing no one should have any problem with a law passed, right?
I think you are entirely correct. From the page VOR linked:
So, if there was a way to know that that baby would be infertile it would be alright in your view to abort?
Not entirely true. While we can't disprove that God created the universe, we can disprove many creationist claims. For example, we can disprove that the earth is 6000 years old.
And it is. The ToE is a theory, however. It explains evolution, which has been observed. Do not attempt to deny that.
No one wants to take your "marriage" away Matt. It's a free country--no one's going to block your way to any chapel that will marry you. Do your gay thing. But let marriage be marriage--it's a different matter. People just want to keep you from tampering with the institution of marriage.
See Above.I can't help but notice your signature. What are you, Patriot under a different username? Bad show, Patriot. Sock Puppets aren't good debate form.Patriot-- About your statement that you've been vindicated. I hope you're just fooling around. :)TruthSeeker's first post doesn't even belong in a debate forum. She stated an opinion, and then stated absolutely nothing to back it up in any way. No evidence. No reasoning. Not one "because". Nothing. It was like entering a presidential candidate debate and saying, "I think the other guy sucks" and leaving. Hence why I asked her as politely as possible to elaborate.
When the needs of the two are in conflict this is unavoidable.
Actually, I don't remember that they did. What they did take bets on was that AIG would be able to find enough stupid people who would buy into their ignorant and scientifically illiterate tripe. As I recall, most who were actually aware of how stupid creationists can be bet that they would be able to do so. So now, besides their other so called 'peer reviewed' magazine, they want to pretend that they are doing science here.
Exactly, which brings us back to square 1. Creationism is based on religion, and Evolution is based on the Scientific method, but is not proven. Creationism isnt even near being proven. So, why would you try to impose your religious beliefs on public school children?
just isn't the case in countries with nationalised health care, yet those countries also have a large number of pharmaceutical companies that are based there.
Yet another application of a different meaning of the word in an effort to group everything in science that you don't understand and won't accept under one word.
Again, modern birds seem to do fine as do gliding mammals such as flying squirrels.
Too much spin there buddy. The potentiality arguement is used by those who believe women have a right to have control over their fertility. As an aside it is also a fundemental tenent in Judaism's view of the unborn- the foetus is a potential life, but has not yet attained that state of being, which occurs at birth.
And you think this a good thing? It just shows the weak cowardly position of the creationist.
No, there isn't a consensus among Christians, at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing. There is no consensus about method.
Do you see the other cities pushing for outrageous standards like NYC?
Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.We all lead your typical normal life.
If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional, then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind.
The original molecule had some lipolytic function, but removing some amino acids from it, in the right place, made it fit better into the substrate, and thereby greatly increased its functionality. Barbarian observes:We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. .
A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one.
Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc...
Stevens said that bear arms has a military meaning. So was he saying that the right is individual but existed in connection with militia service? Is this some kind of hybrid model? Interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation. 
And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. That's not what a Democracy is about, at least not our Democracy.
That's not true -- actually, it doesn't make sense. Science is just a bunch of rules (by definition). "Biology uses science to study life" is true. "Physics uses science to study the physical world" is true, but "science's purpose is to study life" is not true. 
Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.
Ah ha! Someone who understands the application of information theory to biological organisms. By the biological specific definition of information, the genome of any organism is information about the environment in which it lives.
It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!
But himps living in the jungle were in competition with other himps which didn't migrate to the plains. And pressures from predators, climate and changes in the ecosystem should have continued to force the need or desire to control their environment as our line of himp grew to do. My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction.
It's not a literal account unless you interpret it that way.
Since they are issued by the military I would think so. 
Let's not confuse our readers. supersport is not saying it's evolution; he's saying that "evolutionists" say that it's evolution. It should be clear now to the readers that scientists recognized perfectly well that this is an example of plasticity.
That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4. Did our bodies once produce Vitamin C?.
Actually all decisions based on the self ARE selfish decisions. I really don't care. I make them all the time too. Everyone does. While this is a philosophical issue I really see it as odd that people claim not to be selfish when doing something that benefits them or prevents harm to them with little regard to anyone else.
I believe it's there, but I'm certainly no one to push that belief on anyone.
Sigma I have taken into account the options a woman has after pregnancy. However, there are no doubt cases in the history of the world (not just within America) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child (ie: the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world). For this pro-choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation. Are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her?
I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few.
You can do whatever you want to do with your money. The fact that you don't know any better than to do that with your money is telling, though. If you think that the C(R)SC actually does ID-based scientific research, you're exactly the dupe they're looking for.I'm serious. Do the research for yourself. I won't even give you links, because you'll XXXX them off as propaganda. Find any scientific journal article written by a DI member that's actually based on actual scientific experimentation or investigation and supports ID. I dare you.
Do you think that the woman will not relive the rape on a daily basis if she destroys the child? Not likely. I think she will still suffer through those thoughts. Killing the baby complicates this. What happens if she has horrible thoughts about a rape with more thoughts about the abortion?
I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.
Evolution's evidence is that life is similar, you won't be able to find an exception I am sure.
So, because she's bigger, she can kill the fetus off? That is generally the idea the school yard bully has.
There's a distinct difference... so what? No baby at any age can live outside the womb. It still needs care and attention like any other. This difference in age doesn't mean anything.
that is not true. a levitating guru that has been seen and proven to levitate doesnt make the process natural. an alien that has been seen and proven to teleport and abduct people in their retractor beam doesnt make the process less paranormal. the definition of supernatural/paranormal doesnt automatically mean they can never be observed, just that they defy physical law. the definition of God is a special case that includes never being observed/proven
So everyone thinks that "evolutionists" should seize power or something? If that is true, it is because evolution is very widely accepted.
They can "marry" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.
That and VOR keeps flip flopping on his positions and he refuses to clarify his contridictions.
You believe two things that are incorrect: that you have refuted evolutionary theory, and that we will now accept intellegent design because of your attempt.
How do you know there isn't a tiger in the bathroom? You feel very strongly and have over-whelming evidence that there is no tiger in your bathroom? (You live in an urban area, there are no zoos, you don't hear scratching or biting or the maiming of your poodle, and the water is going) But you cannot prove a negative. Which is also why you won't be able to prove that creationism is wrong, and why we can't prove evolution is wrong. The focus must be on proving one right. How you might do that depends on your method of reasoning and thought.
If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too. However, you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work.
#2 was questioning the personal, non-scientific beliefs of the evolution believer
There's no adding of firearms going on, because they're already there! The criminals have them, that's a hard fact of life that can't ever be changed. Deal with it. What we want is for the intended victims to be on equal footing with the bad guys. There's nothing unreasonable about that.
Cars are a privilege, your gun isn't. Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional.
I laughed when I first saw the ad on MSNBC's Hardball tonight. It shows the fear, insecurities and the fallacies that guide anti-gay equality rights activists.
Sorry to inform you, but until you are 18 years old in this country, you are not granted full protection of your rights under the constitution of the united states. I don't agree with testing either, but saying that it violates your rights is not a valid argument. 
Actually, it is. There are multitudes of known characteristics that have been shown to be the result of a single point difference in the gene. The discovery of regulatory functions of some translated segments of DNA does not in any way discount what is known about gene function.
it is no "story"........i am debating on the whole evolution thing... look at the facts. so many great ppl, physics people, niels bohr, he was for evoulution, then he found out all of the facts that it is junk, so he became a christian
We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term "brain-dead"), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead
This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a "special right" is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays...... but for most people, they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit.I think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee's sexual orientation.But to utilize your phrasing Archie, do you think that religion is something that deserves "special rights"?
"Healthy Families" seems like a strange name for this group that the link is to.
actually, it can be proven whether leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, magical space monkeys and livining care baers, and even god, exists or not.the question of proving a belief seems kinda self-contradictory to me. if something is a fact that can be proven, then your belief about it is irrelevant. likewise, if you believe something, whether there are facts to support it or not, its still your belief. there are people who believe things inn the absence of supporting facts, and sometimes even in the face of opposing facts. the term for that is faithfaith is the belief of something in the absence of evidence. if you have faith in something, proof is irrelevant, or at least it should be
But you know what really doesn't make sense? Why are they evangelising to people (who they know most of them will reject them) if those people get a special dispensation? They'd be condemning people to hell by evangelizing, would they not? Why not leave the people be and let them get the special dispensation? emoticonXConfused
That is not quite what the 'mitochondrial Eve' hypothesis posits.Science. 1995 Dec 22;270(5244):1930-6. The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the "mitochondrial Eve" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies.
I see no reason why secular shows should be required to mention your mythology.
Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT.
I believe the question was "who?"I'm christian and I believe in evolution. Whether it contradicts the Old Testament or not makes no difference to me. Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now.
In what universe is there a right to murder?Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.What certain activities are forbidden in public?Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.
Well you don't need to doubt it. I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need.
They are: those that survive better reproduce more. Members of a species can die if other members have better food/light/attention/camaflouge.
See above. Give kids credit. You give them a bogus answer and they will know. We have got to stop treating sex like a dirty little secret.
And if we can actually doing anything about it. From what I hear on the fringes, the debate should not be about how to change or stop it, but how to change to deal with it and what we should expect as society adapts to a change in climate.
It can't come up with evidence if it's suppressed from future generations. Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have.
I think you misunderstand my view. I think that a third-term fetus is already sufficiently a person, so I would CERTAINLY consider a newborn baby a person. To me, a person is one who has the most basic, rudimentary sense of thought and emotion. A late-term fetus, from my point of view, is no less a person than an Einstein. An Einstein, of course, is much more useful to a much greater number of people, but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person, I would say not.
Well this involves the free will / determinism debate, you say you aren't free if your preferences are implanted... I say you are free when you act in accordance with your preferences, regardless of how those preferences were arrived at. I think to claim you need to "choose" your preferences is absurd, as the act of choosing requires prior preferences, which presumably also required a choice.... and the question of how we acquired our first preference arises...
That's the thing, though; even a self-professed non-expert can perfectly well refute the ridiculous points supersport continually spouts. supersport, on the other hand, doesn't know any better.
The fact that it's the truth is why I keep repeating it.
Sorry to shatter you little world but this is happening it has been happening 25 years and it is happening now and it is completly legal no laws have been broken and yes there is a market for fetal tissue /limbs and bodies.Do some research you will be surprised what you will find.
Mythology. But nevertheless, shipbuilding has been going on for a lot longer than 500 years. There have been a lot of skilled shipbuilders who have passed along their knowledge from generation to generation. Do you think that every time someone builds a ship that they invent the whole process? Nah. 300 ft is about the limit for wood no matter how you design it. Even worse it you cast a big box adrift in a huge storm. How did the animals survive the rolling and rolling?
Somehow I don't think a high percentage of Ham's "facts" are facts.
I'm afraid it is you who is wrong. I created you so that you would think you created me to think I created everything, even though I did. It's more of a challenge that way to try to convert people to the one true religion. Since you can see that I won't be able to convert the world (it's due in a week), you can pay $100 dollars to me so I will take you with me to the upper world.
Yes, everyone is a "potential" felon. Fortunately most people never commit a felony. And there are many different types of weapons, all which could be used by previously law abiding citizens to commit an act of violence.
Because some restrictions that might pass constitutional muster, don't amount to an outright ban. How would impossibility ever be considered constitutional?
Since when does the fate get decided by the victim? A woman could be said to have a biased opinion on it because she is an involved party. Even so, I take the stand that no one has any authority over the other to make that decision.
The short answer is that it isn't. See the details here: Phil Plait
Yes. The assumption happens to be that maybe the bible isn't literal. "Lets look into ourselves, shall we?" Behold we did, and Lo! The Earth is old!
No. It steps firmly in the realm of REALITY Jyoshu.Have you never heard people talk about how police in an area respond in X amount of time for one situation, but for a different situation, like in a neighborhood predominantly black or gay or ___, the response time is four times as long?Have you never heard of how there have been cases where people have died because they tried to get medical help at the "white" hospital?Or how about you read about THIS case and tell me that these concerns aren't real...
No, but the Roman persecution of Christians, covering Christians in pitch, Roman garden parties, witnesses for Christ being killed for their faith etc. is as irrelevant as it gets. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. There is a place for that topic.
Again? What do you mean? I am talking about different sciences per se. What is your question?
Sounds like the same skeptic argument above. I don't know about you Nu Leader, but when I'm certain my mind exists. Are you not certain? You are actually required to be, to deny you exist would require existence, and that would be logically contradictory.
The criminals in DC already have their guns. All striking down DC's handgun ban will do is let the law abiding be able to better defend themselves and be armed for a change.
Oh, undoubtedly - but the offspring aren't inheriting traits as such are they? They're just suffering the same symptoms of malnutrition as their parents, except that for them it's happening in vitro so they exhibit the effects from birth. That's why it's such a bad example for what you're trying to get others to accept.
But the embryo is a mere clump of flesh inside of a woman's body. Science proves it. It has no sign of intelligence, it is merely cells at this stage. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as another person, or neighbor, and is no where near comparable to a human. Choices that harm another should be illegal, but choices regarding your own personal liberty and freedom should be made by the individual. Not the government.
So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant.
And, what percentage is that? How was the poll conducted? Who conducted it? How was the determination made about who was a 'scientist'?
That is true but that is the procedure.........Do you deny it?
But the whole process was done in the courts using the process set up by the constitution. Where the laws are not clear on an issue, such as in Massachusetts, it is the courts job to decide. The courts are a check on the injustice towards minorities by the majority.
I believe I said I would change my view. I will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic.
Please note that I added the word "human" to your comment above IANGB. After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / "persons." Agree? Also, I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights (life) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have.
I believe that science explains the way God created the universe.
Just because a man pays support doesn't mean he is part of the childs life.He has no obligation to do *fatherly* things with his child.Women pay child support BTW.
That was a nice rant that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. The essential question is not what various religous leaders have said about the issue, but what the Bible says about the issue.
First of all, it's not a precedent. this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional. Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called "lawlessness". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some "agenda" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us.
You got it. People make mistakes. Finally you see that scientists are just as human as religious people.
O they don't make space anymore. They'll just put him in a cell with pot growers and crack addicts. He'll be lucky if he gets a spot on the floor to sleep on.
no base for calling it a human being? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being. Seems you have no basis for saying I can't call a fetus a human being.
What you quoted is what Answers in Genesis said. Please do not be dishonest and tell others that I said this as I did not.
This is simply false. Rock can be folded under pressure. This has been proven by lab experiment. However there are many features in sedimentary rocks that cannot be formed quickly, for example, fossil trackways.
The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section.
Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals.
Well, that's your claim, anyway. Truth is that billions of theists accept evolutionary theory as is and reject the standard ID arguments.
But wouldn't the biochemical similarities speak for themselves? That is, does one have to believe that the two specimens (which share biochemical similarities) evolved in order to infer that they will respond similarly to antibiotics? The observable facts of the similarities would seem sufficient (and more scientific?).
And for the record, i think anyone that tries to take away a women's right to her own body is a sexist and has no respect for human life, or has any concious about the woman at stake here. You care merely about a couple of cells and not about the real humans, nor do you care about society. It seems to me you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in heavan. I am not influenced by that, im going to have my own opinions, and speak about what i feel is right instead of some christian god telling me what to do.
If you can't eliminate demand you could try to limit supply and control access to that supply.
Why would they be useless? They aren't useless on birds? And how is this qustion different in any meaningful way from the above? Aren't wings forelimbs with feathers? It seems that soaring or gliding or even faster running would be extremely useful.
He made a post suggesting you were a troll, it has been removed it seems. Anyway, glad to help.
Well let's deal with one thing at a time. The NEJM study about Washington D.C. concluded that banning handguns saved 47 lives each year. The study didn't conclude that it was just a "curious relationship in the numbers." Go back to that thread and read the study. If you're looking for evidence that is absolutely without any degree of uncertainty then you won't find it. You can't prove things to a 100% certainty with statistics. What you can do is show what is probably true and what is probably not true. Even in court you're not expected to prove that someone is guilty to a 100% certainty. You're expected to prove that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Erm... we are? Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are usually quoted as parts per million, currently a little over 380ppm, 150 years ago closer to 280. In 1970 about 330ppm.   Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
That would most likely (imo) reduce the number of abortions performed. It would depend, I think, on how viable it is to transfer the embryo into the artificial womb. Forced surgery would not be an option if I had anything to do about it.
Really? A human can be determined scientifically. Personhood is a human legal construct. You cannot prove scientifically what a "person" is.
I wouldn't say most cjurches, because you cannot prove that. There is a long list of churches that are accepting of gay folks.
In the examples you gave, the doctor is clearly trying his* very best to save the most lives he can. What if the Siamese twins were in no mortal danger while together? And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?*(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use "his/her" or "he/she"... it just gets tiring after a while...)
A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S.
Not sure how you can tell that since very little is mentioned about his methods.
I did not say that evolution precludes God, all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God. If a person does not beleive in God, then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality.
732,000 DIDN'T sign the petition. It seems only 5% of South Dakotans say "repeal the extreme abortion ban" and that is ASSUMING that all the signatures are valid. The good news for South Dakota is that come November they can show America how they really feel about abortion as opposed to having the courts decide laws.
jessica, all these problems you've listed, the human body takes care of automatically and remarkably well. the fact still remains that only less than 5% of all abortions occur because the risk is great enough to be deemed life-threatening to either tha mother or the child. and that percentage is diminishing as well. the overwhelming majority of abortions occur simply because the woman decides she does not wnat to be a mother.
Well he HAS admitted he can't prove his belief. I guess that posting here would admit his false dichotomies that it's either literal genesis or evolution are false and god knows the world will end when that happens. Super admitting he's wrong? Never going to happen.
DC has a law that human and civil rights can not be put up for a vote, this is the way it should be in the rest of the country. Why do you want to be able to vote on other peoples lives? Why is it that you are so cruel?
And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera.Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences.
You can do so, and if I don't check your source I guess I'm SOL, eh? I've seen the story many places, but this is beyond simply a site dedicated to outing Bush since its a radio show :P
Of course the bolshevik revolution was doomed from the start as Russia was not indsutrialised and the revolution was imposed by a minority of the bourgeoisie rather than a mass movement of the proletariat (not that there was a proletariat in Russia at the time).
The goal of anti-abortionist is clear. The job of self restraint is that of each participant in their close encounters.
Just like no one is really "for" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war.
The guy can have an opinion but the ultimate choice is up to the woman who can listen to what the guy says or not, it's up to her. I believe that is what sinjin was saying.
Ditto squared. If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified. And I must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason, the public stance against them might not be so strong.
Yes, it's very subjective. I was using evil as an example that was incorrectly used on the website. Even though evil is subjective, you can still be evil. (you can do evil to take away your goodness, but the only way to make yourself colder is by removing your heat, not adding "cold")
Then how exactly did a time capsule that was buried several feet underground get to the surface at the same rate as the surrounding area?
Yet without it the vessel is just worms, mud, then dust, like rock & tree houses, not made to endure, yet, the life force, energy, back to the cosmos/source, converted, capable of being rewinded, paused, and fastfowarded, like a movie screen amongst the stars, revealing our lives.
It doesn't have to be that way because it's the death penalty. It's that way because of our ever deteriorating legal system.
Because of? Hardly. I feel it does change the morality of it, but it is not the sole criteria.
Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view.
He had ALREADY MADE the animals. "now the Lord God HAD FORMED..." not "now the Lord God formed..." See the difference? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam. He made the animals before Adam.
I did not say that violent crime "rarely" occurs, merely that the risk of being a victim of such is lower relative to other risks. I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals.
And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?
I think its actually the states job...the judiciary does need to overturn Roe v. Wade to get this done though...which doesn't mean it becomes illegal.
emoticonXWowYou are making up your own strawman arguments as you go along.Asking "what they would need" is a poor mask to avoid the fact that YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE in the first place.A lot of "doesn't this look like ...", but that's akin to interpreting Rorschach tests. You see what you want to.
Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it.
Even if it was murder, do you really expect me to side with the party that broke into Martin's house and robbed him?
Hmm, when you say "numberless" do you mean something other than the standard definition of infinite? If not, please explain how an infinite number of organisms could be created in a finite time with finite space and resources. Thank you.
There are several scientific explanations for the nature of the earth. Some use 'science' to say that the world is flat. Granted that these beliefs aren't widely accepted, but then not all religions are widely accepted. By your reasoning or 'logic' you must ask yourself about whether you should rely on science when there are many different scientific theories.The Flat Earth News, at least back then, had a regular column, "One Hundred Proofs Earth is Not a Globe."(go to http://www.flat-earth.org/)Other theories taught as sciencephrenologyalchemyevolutioneugenicsneptunismTheories of the Aether Articles relating to the Emergence of Scientific Theories of the Cosmic Aether(http://www.mountainman.com.au/aether.html)What about 'metascience'?http://www.calresco.org/lucas/science.htmOr, sciences used to support political ends...What about Marxist Sciencehttp://www.marxists.org/archive/hald...philosophy.htmor Chaos Theory and Marxismhttp://www.marxist.com/science/chaostheory.htmlThere's Nazi Sciencehttp://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/naziscience.htmlNationalist Sciencehttp://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htmOr social ends...Scientific Racismhttp://www.press.uillinois.edu/f02/tucker.htmlMainstream scientists instead of using the word 'heretic' use the word 'pseudo-science' to categorise fringe beliefs.
Been saying that ever since the first time I heard about creationsism.
Right. It's called stasis. Species that are well adapted to their environments tend to change little in a stable environment. It is still true that fossil crocs are not the same as modern crocs. There are obvious differences.
I believe you mean pro-choice, don't you. A pro-life mod might agree with you.
Notice that even in this version there are elipses just before the quote in question. My bet is if we were to actually refer to this 44 years old book, Simpson would not be saying what Toxey wants him to say.
Are you sure? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair. Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone.
Actually, scientists who discard the global flood are taken seriously.
Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.
So much for lists of registration and "safe storage". Same thing happened when Hitler took over a country and got hold of all the lists. They were especially interested in the gun lists and radio lists.
Homo habilis is the first species to use fire as a tool I think.
If he lies about being pro-life, what else will he be willing to lie about in order to be elected? That is a legitimate, not-made-up issue that is relevant to elections.
They are merely taking chemicals that they can detect in outer space and reproducing the enviroment they are found in, by exposing them to ultraviolet. You are exposed to ultraviolet when you walk outside in the sunshine.Every chemical that they used is readily detected in interstellar molecular clouds.
Oh I certainly don't pretend that and certainly didn't claim that either--though a couple of left-wing posters here (who will remain nameless for now) might take the bizarre step of saying my post to you amounted to as much, if history is any indicator. Maybe we'll all luck out and they'll forget their Lenses of Bias at home, and instead read claims people actually make.
JFriday:In fairness, no one, pro or ant-gun can ever use UK stats to support thier argument again. Back in Jan '03 the UK government finally came clean and announced that they had been seriously fu**ing with crime statistics.You can make the argument that the UK state had something to hide with guncontrol and you would probably be right. Reliable information from UK ministries should now be accepted as less than credible.
This is not true. Rather, when there is conflict between one's sanctity of life vs another's quality of life, the sanctity of life must win.
What's a "marriage officer"? If that's like a priest or minister, than certainly they shouldn't have to perform a ceremony that doesn't coincide with their beliefs. But if it's a government position, like a justice of the peace, then they should either leave their religion at home when they go to work, or get a job that doesn't conflict with their beliefs. Religious freedom does not give you the freedom to deny freedom to someone else.
Yet he hasn't. No pro-choice person I know wants abortion to be prevalent, they just want it to be an option. Wanting it safe and rare and available is not an abnormal positon for a pro-choice person.
So gay people, in your opinion, have no right to form the families of their choice? So you are defending the continued oppression of gay people?We are sick of conservative family types. We are tired of the closet. The phrase "we are mad as hell and we are not going to take it any more" applies. I see in your response the comming of the camps to lock and exterminate gay people. It is that type of thought, that jews were subhuman, that led to the final solution. As it is here with conservatives and religious right nuts, who believe gay people are sub human sickos in need of curing or killing.
Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? Where do they get that power Constitutionally? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally. I think that marriage is a church issue. Let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. But leave marriage to the churches.
When you have no constructive comment just attacks the messenger with your insultsand name calling.....typical...............so very sad..........Its radicals like you that hurt the cause of gay rights.........
I don't find it surprising. It's probably a strategic sacrifice on their part rather than a change in their personal views . They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress. It's all politics.
False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself.
By all means, burn those books . . . er, I mean, take down those nativity scenes.
Well, assuming that when the Bible says "you" in passages that are telling "you" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says "women and men have souls." This doesn't mean they don't have them.Same thing with animals. The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says "you" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. But the book never says "animals don't have souls."So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).
Well done Monty. Mark that up as your first ever 100% honest and accurate post here.
So, the Supreme Court rested its decision not on the 9th Amendment as the District Court had done, but chose instead to base it on the 14th Amendment.
Got evidence to back that up??      I'm not sure how a stoner's worse than an alcoholic really.      -Wez
because that's the subject of this thread: what designing a solution to a problem actually entails.
That's not quite right. More accurate would be: Nothing that occurs outside the realm of physical law is in the realm of science. Science by no means precludes the possibility of there being something outside the realm of science.
My mom can only trace her family back a few generations. By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century, the records get very confusing and very incomplete. By creationist logic, we must then accept that my ancestors, white Americans, were specially created in North America by God.
You lost this debate Skeptic, why drag it back up again? There are plenty of other subjects that we could debate instead. Pick one of them and let's debate again. Alternatively, how about a formal debate on ID in which you never once mention Behe? That'll be a completely different one and worth considering.
You mean, the perpetrator is convicted and the defender acquitted? Yes, that's the rule and not the exception. Notice here how no-one ended up dead, or even particularly seriously injured. Additionally the circumstances described are incredibly rare, that's why it makes the news.
The article continues to comment that this mechanism serves as a mechanism tailored for evolution? Irrespective of its origins, somehow, life utilizes evolution FOR evolution.      B. Convergence   As seen in the docking simulation, the solutions all converg
Really? Let me see. Two creation myths and a global flood myth where 5 million "kinds" of animal were crammed into a big box that magically floats for a year - yeah, that's secular history.
There are some very rare cases where abortion is legitimately allowable by society. However, most abortions do not fall under this catagory.
Not really. World forests are at risk for farm land and non-paper logging, not for paper which is being replaced by post consumer waste at increasing rates. Most paper people use today contains at least some recycled paper.
And for years they did. They still can. Again, there is not a real problem with pirates.
Yep - that's someting that many "pro-lifers" also never take into account.
So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.
Actually, the more educated a person is, the less likely he is to be a creationist. Creationists tend to be semi-literate (poorly educated), rural, poor, and female.
But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the "logical" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and "make sense" to more than one person, these specific "explanations" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.
Simple. The big government people will tell you that it's in everybody's best interest. The criminals will just kill you without debate.
Oh, there's no hypocrisy involved, just you being your usual self and not even looking at the actual information (or, more likely, looking at the information and then deliberately playing dumb).
No, it's often an emotional show. They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing. The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him. There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticonXWow
I wish you could put your hands on that poll as well. Until then I'll remain skeptical. Let's remember that Democrats and liberals hunt. Remove that group and what's left? Something less than 20% of Americans that own only handguns.
Not in matters of atheism. Tell me, when science discovers something that seems to agree with the 150 year old writings of Darwin, are the writings of Darwin disregarded? Or is that type of history trumpeted to the masses?
I suppose the fact that Indian law only applies to its people. Who qualifies as an Indian is another matter. Many people who have as little as one-tenth Indian blood qualify for liberal hunting privileges here in Minnesota.
Because there are no dinosaur fossils above the iridium layer.
Well it all depends on who is going to determine "right", isn't it? Abortion is not math. There are no finite answers. Just a myriad of opinions which inevitable lead to either abortion is right or abortion is wrong. No different now then when Roe v Wade became law or any other times in history. I do like Aristotle's take; He taught that a fetus originally had a vegetable soul but he didn't say what kind of vegetable.
How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?
Well, by the strict defintion of the word "born", an abortion is considered a premature birth.
Well, if they've re-established control in New Orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. If they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (I'm very pro-2nd Amendment, so don't get me wrong here. I'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)I also think that it's kind of disingenuous to complain about the military coming in--just a week ago everyone was criticizing the govt. for NOT sending in the military. Now people are criticizing them for doing it???
Your reason for believing this lies entirely within the Bible. I hardly consider a 1500 year old book "making clear what he wants". Particularly given that even among those who believe the book, they still can't agree on what God wants. And of course, that doesn't even beging to address the issue of all the other holy books which contradict the Christian Bible. You may personally believe that you know what God wants, but if so it's not because God has been clear about it.
Reading Difficulties, huh?      There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there.....
The problem with happenstance origins is that there is no evidence, and it's simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove so many scientific proceedures (from abiogenesis to radiometric dating - all based on the presupposition that there is no God) were indisputably true, then ID would be falsified. There is not enough supporting evidence for happenstance origins. Yet so much of happenstance origins is considered science, so all too often, there is no line between religion and science. 
sinjin - I didn't mean to imply any linkage between your opinions and those of another poster. Apologies.
This is my understanding as well. Interestingly, concepts only approximate that which they intend to define. Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding.
And here our Government recognizes:  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people
i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular englishand yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a "possibility of existence". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: "greatest possible being". the "greatest possible being", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole "proof" is pointless because your premise is already the proofjust keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as "the greatest being possible". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled
You know that what you call "immoralism" is my life. Why do you hate me so much that you would be willing to deny my the happiness that you take forgranted and as your due? You don't even know me yet you are willing to defame me just because I am different from you. I don't understand how I am running over you by living my life openly and wanting the same thing as you the right to consider whom I choose to be my family. If you have an opinion about gay rights thats fine. If you want to deny me the same rights, as you take for granted, because of your opinion and beliefs though laws then that is bigotry.
You're a little confused about that. It's all real DNA. Some of it just doesn't code for anything. But some parts of non-coding DNA (which you call "junk") has other functions besides coding for proteins.
Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick.
What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking.
But my point is that the Supreme Court has disagreed. Hence the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process, which maintains that the due process clause can be violated even in cases where due process has been given.
So Lewontin is the person who determines the opinion of the general public or something?
If a God exists, then God is as God is.
Look up the evolution of colour vision in primates. It's my personal favourite - but what do you think?
I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. Any thoughts on this?
You yourself said you don't even know what the gun laws in California are. Yet you're saying there you believe they have legitimate tests?
You think open carrying of loaded handguns in public will become fashionable in CA?   I think if anyone took to this they'd find themselves asked to leave establishments routinely.
If the child is to be born into a poverty stricken part of the world and is expected to die by the age of 7 by either disease or lack of food, why not spare pain and abort?
And this is a terrific breakthrough. My partner and I are coveered by my company's health insurance, and the state of Connecticut honors our Civil Union. That being said, I still have to pay tax on my partner's health insurance as imputed income because the federal government refuses to acknowledge our union.So it has to be marriage. Full and without exception.Civil Unions are not enough when we are treated differently under the law.
actually, the only valid question plotter asked is about the existence of dinosaurs (How did they fit into the creation schedule?) Good question plotter...Plotter: "when did he create all the other planets, when did he create all the other stars and comets?"Gen. 1:14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so. and XQ, what stories are you talking about?
And are people in DC legally allowed to carry their guns with them in a concealed manner, having them readily available like the rest of us do in the country?Absolutely not. According to DC your rights don't extend past your home, and it barely even exists inside your home.
I think that case was in Georgia (a different state) and so far as I know homosexuality was not involved. However if you want to worry about a legal case you need to look at Dover Pa. Not the sticker case in Cobb County.
That's not something you can really blame on the pro-life movement. In fact, a lot of effort in the pro-life movement does go into helping single mothers. Many pro-life counseling services help single mothers offering support in a variety of ways, including financially.
Giving an answer to a conumdum doesn't necessarily solve it.
but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo. An argument made for slavery was that "you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do"..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned.
Actually your posts are providing increasing evidence for just how simple folks can get.
Most Christians are, as is frequently pointed out by numerous posters in many different threads on this board.
Because that's when the law says that they have the 'right to live.' Rights are legal terms that are fabricated by humans. They are not constant, but rather change whenever we wish to change them.
And a lot of blacks were killed through hangings. Are you against rope vendors?
First of all, when gun owners say ban guns, it means, if you want to ban ANY Gun, you are a gun banner! You guys want to muck up the argument with we don't want to ban all guns, just some guns! However, that statement is just for now! If you get the ban more will be following!   Nelson T. 'Pete' Shields -- Founder of Handgun Control, Inc.
